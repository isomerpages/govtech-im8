## LM-1: Separate Log Storage

### Control Statement

Store logs in a repository that is part of a different system or system component than the system or component being audited.

### Control Recommendations

Send logs to the separate storage as soon as possible after the logged event. For cloud audit logs, store them in a separate service or account (such as AWS Organisation Cloudtrail in GCC). Sending logs to the Government Cyber Security Operations Centre (GCSOC) or the central Government Commercial Cloud (GCC) log bucket can also satisfy this control.

### Risk Statement

Storing logs in a repository separate from the audited system or component enhances security by reducing the risk of tampering, unauthorised access, and manipulation of audit trails, ensuring the integrity and reliability of log data for forensic analysis and compliance purposes.



<a id="lm-2"></a>
## LM-2: Tamper-Resistant Log Storage

### Control Statement

Protect logs from unauthorised access, modification, and deletion.

### Control Recommendations

Apply access control policies to logs based on the principle of least privilege. As far as possible, only read access should be granted. Logs sent to GCC Central Logs are tamper-resistant.

### Risk Statement

Without protection measures, logs are susceptible to unauthorised access, modification, or deletion, leading to the risk of tampering, loss of crucial audit information, and compromised forensic analysis capabilities during security incidents.



<a id="lm-3"></a>
## LM-3: Network Flow Logging

<a id="lm-7"></a>
## LM-7: Security Event Logging

### Control Statement

Log security events on hosts and other cloud resources.

### Control Recommendations

Security events include operating system security events, authentication and audit logs, and endpoint detection and response alerts.

### Risk Statement

Neglecting to log security events on hosts and other cloud resources increases the risk of undetected security incidents, compromises incident response capabilities, and hinders forensic analysis, limiting the ability to identify and mitigate potential threats.



<a id="lm-8"></a>
## LM-8: Security Log Retention

### Control Statement

Retain security logs for at least [lm-8_prm_1] day(s).

### Control Recommendations

Security logs include network flow logs, cloud management logs, access logs, database logs and host logs. Retain non-security logs (e.g. application, operations and performance logs) as long as needed for incident resolution and debugging. Consider log lifecycle management automation, such as Amazon S3 Lifecycle configurations.

### Risk Statement

Failure to retain security logs increases the risk of losing crucial historical data, hindering investigations, compliance audits, and the ability to identify and respond to security incidents that occurred beyond a limited timeframe.



#### Parameters

| ID | Type | Description |
| -- | ---- | ----------- |
| lm-8_prm_1 | time period (days) | The time period in days of log retention. |

## LM-9: Security Monitoring and Alerting

### Control Statement

Configure security monitoring to identify potential security violations or breaches and send automated alerts.

### Control Recommendations

Enable Amazon GuardDuty, Microsoft Azure Security Center, or their equivalents.

### Risk Statement

Without configuring security monitoring to identify potential security violations or breaches and send automated alerts, there's an increased risk of delayed or unnoticed security incidents, hindering timely response and mitigation efforts to protect the system from further compromise.



<a id="lm-10"></a>
## LM-10: Resource Usage Monitoring and Alerting

### Control Statement

Configure resource usage monitoring to identify abnormal usage and send automated alerts.

### Control Recommendations

Configure Amazon CloudWatch alarms, Azure Monitor alerts, or their equivalents to identify abnormal usage such as spike in usage, access to resources during expected hours, and excessive charges.

### Risk Statement

Lack of resource usage monitoring with automated alerts increases the risk of overlooking abnormal usage patterns, potential resource abuse, and compromises in system performance, hindering the ability to proactively address issues and prevent service disruptions.



<a id="lm-11"></a>
## LM-11: Service Level Monitoring and Alerting

### Control Statement

Monitor, maintain and alert on service level objectives (SLOs) and indicators (SLIs) to ensure consistent service performance, availability and reliability.

### Control Recommendations

Implement a comprehensive monitoring system that tracks key SLIs and evaluates them against defined SLOs. This will help in identifying potential service level breaches early and take proactive measures to maintain service quality. Examples include Cloudwatch metrics and alerts, Amazon Route 53 health checks, Azure Monitor Application Insights, or their equivalents.

### Risk Statement

Without effective service level monitoring to identify potential application or service degradation and send automated alerts, there is a risk of failing to meet service availability standards, which could result in user dissatisfaction and reduced reliability.



<a id="lm-12"></a>
## LM-12: Government Cyber Security Operations Centre (GCSOC)

### Control Statement
