# AC-1: Principle of Least Privilege

* **Group:** [Access Control](/catalog/ac)

## Control Statement

Deny access by default and grant only the minimum permissions required for authorised accounts or processes to perform a specific function.

## Control Recommendations

Consider attribute- or feature-based access control for greater customisability and granularity.

## Risk Statement

Violating the principle of least privileges increases the risk of unauthorised access, privilege escalation, and potential security breaches due to unnecessary permissions, compromising the overall security posture.
