# AC-12: Single Sign-On (SSO) for Internal Users

* **Group:** [Access Control](/catalog/ac)

## Control Statement

Use Single Sign-On (SSO) for internal users and services.

## Control Recommendations

Configure multi-factor authentication (MFA) at the Single-Sign On (SSO) identity provider (IdP) and ensure that access to the system is only granted after the IdP authenticates the user. WOG AAD is recommended for public officers and TechPass AAD for developers.

## Risk Statement

Without Single Sign-On (SSO), there is an increased risk of unauthorized access and compromised user credentials, as users may resort to using weak passwords or reusing credentials across multiple systems, thereby exposing sensitive information to potential security breaches.
