# AC-7: SingPass/CorpPass for External Users

* **Group:** [Access Control](/catalog/ac)

## Control Statement

Use SingPass or CorpPass MFA for digital services that require high level of identity assurance for external users.

## Control Recommendations

For high impact or high risk transactions, use SingPass/CorpPass to identify external users (e.g. citizens). Internal users should use Government managed Single Sign-on (SSO) solutions (such as WOG AAD).

## Risk Statement

Leverage on SingPass or CorpPass to reduce duplication of effort and provide consistent end user experience.
