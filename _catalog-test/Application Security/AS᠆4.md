# AS-4: Authentication Mechanism Rate-Limiting

* **Group:** [Application Security](/catalog/as)

## Control Statement

Apply rate-limiting on all authentication mechanisms to deter brute-force attacks.

## Control Recommendations

Consider rate-limiting to a maximum of 3 consecutive failed authentication attempts within 15 minutes. Time delays between log-on attempts reduce the risk of successful brute-forcing attacks. Bot mitigation tools such as CAPTCHA can further reduce this risk.

## Risk Statement

Without rate-limiting, there&#39;s an increased risk of unauthorised access as attackers may exploit weak credentials through repeated login attempts.
