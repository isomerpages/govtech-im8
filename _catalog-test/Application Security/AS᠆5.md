# AS-5: Password Requirements

* **Group:** [Application Security](/catalog/as)

## Control Statement

Where SSO or passwordless is not supported, verify that user-defined passwords are at least [as-5_prm_1] characters in length and [as-5_prm_2].

## Control Recommendations

Latest NIST [SP 800-63B](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b) guidelines found that password length is a primary factor in determining the strength of a password while composition and complexity rules provide marginal security benefits.

## Risk Statement

Short or commonly used passwords increase the vulnerability to unauthorised access, potentially leading to compromised accounts and unauthorised activities on the system.



### Parameters

| ID | Type | Description |
| -- | ---- | ----------- |
| as-5_prm_1 | number of characters | The minimum length of a password. |
| as-5_prm_2 | policy | The password policy. |
