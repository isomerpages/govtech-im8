# AS-8: Application Secrets Management

* **Group:** [Application Security](/catalog/as)

## Control Statement

Encrypt and store application secrets in a secret management solution with appropriate access controls and do not hard-code secrets in source code.

## Control Recommendations

Secret management solutions include cloud solutions like AWS Secrets Manager and Azure Key Vault as well as cloud-agnostic solutions like HashiCorp Vault and CyberArk Conjur.

## Risk Statement

Exposure of sensitive information and unauthorised access to system credentials may occur if application secrets are stored without encryption or if hard-coded in source code.
