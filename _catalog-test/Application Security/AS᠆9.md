# AS-9: Content Security Policy (CSP)

* **Group:** [Application Security](/catalog/as)

## Control Statement

Set minimally permissive CSP response headers to mitigate cross-site scripting attacks.

## Control Recommendations

Utilise the relevant fetch directives such as `default-src`, `script-src`, `style-src`, `connect-src`, `img-src`, `media-src` and `object-src` to prevent loading of scripts from malicious sources. Refer to the [OWASP Secure Headers Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers) Best Practices for recommended header values.

## Risk Statement

Without minimally permissive Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, the risk of cross-site scripting attacks, leading to unauthorised script execution and potential data theft, is increased.
