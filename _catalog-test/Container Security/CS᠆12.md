# CS-12: Container Runtime Security

* **Group:** [Container Security](/catalog/cs)

## Control Statement

Detect and remediate changes to running containers with container runtime protection tools.

## Control Recommendations

Runtime protection tools, such as AWS EKS Protection, Microsoft Defender for Containers or Falco, monitor threats and changes to running containers. Vulnerable container instances should be isolated for investigation and replaced with rebuilt and patched images. To avoid persistence if patches do not exist, the container instance should be replaced frequently with an un-compromised image until a patch released. These tools replace Malware Protection (IS-7) and EDR (IS-8) in container environments.

## Risk Statement

Failure to detect and remediate changes to running containers using container runtime protection tools increases the risk of unnoticed compromises, potential exploitation, and unauthorised alterations to containerised applications, compromising the security and integrity of the runtime environment.
