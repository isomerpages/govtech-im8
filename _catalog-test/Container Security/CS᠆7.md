# CS-7: CI/CD Container Image Scanning

* **Group:** [Container Security](/catalog/cs)

## Control Statement

Set up a container image scanning job in the CI/CD pipeline that runs on each container image build.

## Control Recommendations

Container image scanning tools (e.g., Trivy, Grype) scan the contents of a container image or filesystem for known vulnerabilities.

## Risk Statement

Without setting up a container image scanning job in the CI/CD pipeline, there&#39;s an increased risk of deploying vulnerable images, as potential security vulnerabilities may go undetected, compromising the security and integrity of the containerised applications during deployment.
