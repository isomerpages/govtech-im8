# IS-1: Management Agents

* **Group:** [Infrastructure Security](/catalog/is)

## Control Statement

Install CSP management agents on hosts to remotely and securely manage their configurations.

## Control Recommendations

Most CSP compute instances preinstall management agents (e.g., AWS Systems Manager Agent, Azure Windows VM Agent) by default. If the image does not come with the preinstalled agent, install manually.

## Risk Statement

Without installing management agents on hosts, there is an increased risk of manual misconfigurations, difficulty in maintaining consistent configurations, and potential security vulnerabilities due to reduced visibility and ability to manage hosts effectively.
