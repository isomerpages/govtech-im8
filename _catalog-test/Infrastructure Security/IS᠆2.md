# IS-2: Automated Patch Management

* **Group:** [Infrastructure Security](/catalog/is)

## Control Statement

Automate patching of operating systems and applications.

## Control Recommendations

Apply patch baselines via the CSP node management service, unless the patch management process is automated as part of the build and deploy phase.

## Risk Statement

Failure to automate patching of operating systems and applications increases the risk of delayed or missed security updates, leaving systems vulnerable to known exploits and potential security breaches, compromising the overall security of the environment.
