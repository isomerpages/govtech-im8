# IS-3: Restricted Administrator Privileges

* **Group:** [Infrastructure Security](/catalog/is)

## Control Statement

Restrict administrator privileges by disabling remote login for the root/administrator user and removing sudo/administrators group access for other users.

## Control Recommendations

Further reduce the attack surface by running common services such as the web server or database without root/administrator/system privileges.

## Risk Statement

Without restricting administrator privileges, there is an increased risk of unauthorised access, privilege escalation, and potential security breaches, compromising the integrity and security of the system.
