# IS-4: Least Functionality

* **Group:** [Infrastructure Security](/catalog/is)

## Control Statement

Disable or remove unnecessary functions, system ports, protocols, software, and services on the host.

## Control Recommendations

Follow the principle of least functionality to configure the host to carry out only its intended purpose. CSP node management services can provide an inventory of software and services (e.g., AWS Systems Manager Inventory). Vulnerability assessment scanners (e.g., AWS Inspector) can also identify software vulnerabilities and network exposure.

## Risk Statement

Failure to disable or remove unnecessary functions, system ports, protocols, software, and services on the host increases the attack surface, potential vulnerabilities, and the risk of exploitation, compromising the overall security and performance of the system.
