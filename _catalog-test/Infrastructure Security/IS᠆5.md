# IS-5: Host System Hardening

* **Group:** [Infrastructure Security](/catalog/is)

## Control Statement

Harden the host configuration in accordance with industry standards.

## Control Recommendations

Select the appropriate benchmark for the host such as from the [NIST National Checklist Program](https://ncp.nist.gov/repository) or [CIS Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks). Automate the configuration process or use hardened images instead of manually configuring.

## Risk Statement

Without hardening the operating system configuration according to industry standards, there&#39;s an increased risk of security vulnerabilities, unauthorised access, and potential exploitation, compromising the overall security posture and resilience of the operating system.
