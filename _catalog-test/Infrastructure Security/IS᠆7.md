# IS-7: Malware Protection

* **Group:** [Infrastructure Security](/catalog/is)

## Control Statement

Detect and quarantine malware on hosts with anti-malware tools.

## Control Recommendations

Configure anti-malware tools for all compute hosts (e.g. AWS Guardduty Malware Protection, Azure Antimalware, Trend Micro CloudOne). These tools should be kept up-to-date with the latest malware signatures. Regular scans should be scheduled to detect and quarantine potential threats.

## Risk Statement

Without malware protection, there&#39;s an increased risk of undetected malicious activities, potential data breaches, and compromise of host systems, highlighting the importance of proactive measures to ensure the security and integrity of the environment.
