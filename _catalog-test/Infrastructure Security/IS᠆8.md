# IS-8: Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

* **Group:** [Infrastructure Security](/catalog/is)

## Control Statement

Monitor security threats on hosts with an EDR tool.

## Control Recommendations

Implement EDR tools for all compute hosts. Security incident response should be planned and documented for the tool. EDR tools with built-in malware protection should be favoured to reduce additional agents.

## Risk Statement

Failure to monitor security threats on hosts with an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool increases the risk of undetected advanced threats, compromises in host security, and delayed response to potential security incidents, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and proactive threat detection.
