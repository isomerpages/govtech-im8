# LM-11: Service Level Monitoring and Alerting

* **Group:** [Logging and Monitoring](/catalog/lm)

## Control Statement

Monitor, maintain and alert on service level objectives (SLOs) and indicators (SLIs) to ensure consistent service performance, availability and reliability.

## Control Recommendations

Implement a comprehensive monitoring system that tracks key SLIs and evaluates them against defined SLOs. This will help in identifying potential service level breaches early and take proactive measures to maintain service quality. Examples include Cloudwatch metrics and alerts, Amazon Route 53 health checks, Azure Monitor Application Insights, or their equivalents.

## Risk Statement

Without effective service level monitoring to identify potential application or service degradation and send automated alerts, there is a risk of failing to meet service availability standards, which could result in user dissatisfaction and reduced reliability.
