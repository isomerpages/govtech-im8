# LM-13: Database Activity Monitoring

* **Group:** [Logging and Monitoring](/catalog/lm)

## Control Statement

Monitor database activities for anomalous behaviour.

## Control Recommendations

Config RDS Activity Streams and logs with alerts or Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) tools to detect unusual authentication, reads or writes to a database.

## Risk Statement

Neglecting to monitor database activities for anomalous behaviour increases the risk of undetected security threats, unauthorised access, and compromises in data integrity, hindering the ability to identify and respond to potential database-related incidents.
