# LM-5: Database Logging

* **Group:** [Logging and Monitoring](/catalog/lm)

## Control Statement

Log database audit events.

## Control Recommendations

Enable RDS logging for AWS or its equivalents.

## Risk Statement

Neglecting to log database audit events raises the risk of overlooking unauthorised activities, compromises in data security, and hinders the ability to track and investigate security incidents or compliance violations within the database environment.
