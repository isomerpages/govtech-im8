# LM-7: Security Event Logging

* **Group:** [Logging and Monitoring](/catalog/lm)

## Control Statement

Log security events on hosts and other cloud resources.

## Control Recommendations

Security events include operating system security events, authentication and audit logs, and endpoint detection and response alerts.

## Risk Statement

Neglecting to log security events on hosts and other cloud resources increases the risk of undetected security incidents, compromises incident response capabilities, and hinders forensic analysis, limiting the ability to identify and mitigate potential threats.
