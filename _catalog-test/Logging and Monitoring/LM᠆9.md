# LM-9: Security Monitoring and Alerting

* **Group:** [Logging and Monitoring](/catalog/lm)

## Control Statement

Configure security monitoring to identify potential security violations or breaches and send automated alerts.

## Control Recommendations

Enable Amazon GuardDuty, Microsoft Azure Security Center, or their equivalents.

## Risk Statement

Without configuring security monitoring to identify potential security violations or breaches and send automated alerts, there&#39;s an increased risk of delayed or unnoticed security incidents, hindering timely response and mitigation efforts to protect the system from further compromise.
