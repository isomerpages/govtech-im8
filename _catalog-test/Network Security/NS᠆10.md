# NS-10: Private Network Connectivity

* **Group:** [Network Security](/catalog/ns)

## Control Statement

Implement strong access controls, encryption, and logging for remote developer, maintainer, or administrator access to private network resources.

## Control Recommendations

Use strong authentication and MFA (except for mobile GFE). Layered security mechanisms and controls include firewall that inspects traffic from gateway to private network; 

Terminate all remote access connections in a dedicated network segment within the network and restrict access to only systems and services allowed by the Agencies; 

Implement strong encryption for remote access into school staff network;

Only authorised Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) shall be used for remote access connection to SSN;

Make sure that remote access connections are not perpetual or to re-authenticate remote users to the VPN gateway on a periodic basis (such as every four hours); 

Set the maximum number of consecutive failed authentication attempts before account lockout for remote access into SSN; and

Make sure that split tunnelling is not implemented.

## Risk Statement

Weak private network security may expose our network to malicious activities, jeopardizing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical resources.
