# NS-7: Secure Inter-Service Communication

* **Group:** [Network Security](/catalog/ns)

## Control Statement

Ensure communications between services are secure by making them authenticated, authorised and encrypted.

## Control Recommendations

Design and build inter-service communications (e.g., databases, microservices) to be authenticated, authorised and encrypted (e.g., via API gateways, proxies, private endpoint services, message queues, or service meshes). It is recommended to log communication (such as access logs, transaction logs or payloads) between services for detection, monitoring and investigation of incidents.

## Risk Statement

Failure to ensure secure communications between services increases the risk of unauthorised access, data breaches, and potential manipulation of sensitive information during transit.
