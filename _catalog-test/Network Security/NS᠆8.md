# NS-8: Secure Government Enterprise Network (GEN) connectivity

* **Group:** [Network Security](/catalog/ns)

## Control Statement

Route network traffic between on-premises systems and GCC systems through a secure intermediary.

## Control Recommendations

Design and build secure communications to or from on-premises systems (e.g. Government Enterprise Network (GEN)) through a Gateway rather than direct connectivity (e.g. via API gateways, Application proxies or private endpoint services).

## Risk Statement

Routing network traffic through a secure intermediary mitigates the risk of unauthorised access and cross-network compromise in the case of bridging or direct connectivity.
