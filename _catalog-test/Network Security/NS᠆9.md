# NS-9: Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)/Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

* **Group:** [Network Security](/catalog/ns)

## Control Statement

Set up and configure an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)/Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in the network.

## Control Recommendations

Configure network or host IPS/IDS to detect malicious traffic to/from public or untrusted networks.

## Risk Statement

Absence of network or host IPS or IDS in the network increases the likelihood of undetected intrusions, putting sensitive data and system integrity at risk.
