# SD-3: Continuous Integration (CI) Tests

* **Group:** [Secure Development](/catalog/sd)

## Control Statement

Require Continuous Integration (CI) tests to pass before merging into the default branch.

## Control Recommendations

Use GitLab&#39;s protected branch and merge request settings or GitHub&#39;s branch protection settings to enforce this.

## Risk Statement

Failing to require passing Continuous Integration (CI) tests before merging into the default branch increases the risk of introducing faulty code, potential regressions, and compromise of code quality.
