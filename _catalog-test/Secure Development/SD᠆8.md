# SD-8: Deployment Environment Segregation

* **Group:** [Secure Development](/catalog/sd)

## Control Statement

Segregate production and non-production environments including applications, services, data, secrets, roles, and networks.

## Control Recommendations

Achieve segregation using separate Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC) accounts for environments such as production, development, test, and staging. Account segregation enhances security by limiting exposure, simplifies resource and cost management, maintains configuration integrity, facilitates compliance and auditing and streamlines operational tasks. Deploy and operate environments as similarly as possible to enhance debugging and time-to-market.

## Risk Statement

Failure to segregate production and non-production environments increases the risk of unauthorized access, data leaks, and denial of service attacks, as compromises in non-production environments may lead to cascading impacts on production systems.
