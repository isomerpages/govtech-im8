# PM-1: Cybersecurity Incident Management Plan

* **Group:** [Security Programme Management](/catalog/pm)

## Control Statement

Develop, document, and disseminate an agency-level cybersecurity incident management plan to respond to cybersecurity incidents.

## Control Recommendations

Refer to the Government Incident Reporting and Operations Centre (GIROC) [ICT and Data Incident Reporting Resources](https://gccprod.sharepoint.com/sites/GOVTECH-digitalgov/GIROC/SitePages/Useful-Resources.aspx) for an incident management plan and best practices template.

## Risk Statement

Lack of a cybersecurity incident management plan increases the risk of ineffective response to cybersecurity incidents, hindering the ability to contain, mitigate, and recover from security breaches, potentially leading to extended downtime and data compromise.
