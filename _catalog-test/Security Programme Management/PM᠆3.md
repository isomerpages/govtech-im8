# PM-3: System Security Plan (SSP) Development

* **Group:** [Security Programme Management](/catalog/pm)

## Control Statement

Develop and maintain a comprehensive System Security Plan (SSP) that accurately reflects the system characteristics and security controls in place for the organisation&#39;s systems and environments.

## Control Recommendations

The SSP should be detailed, covering all aspects of security controls, roles, responsibilities, and operational processes. Regular updates are necessary to reflect changes in the security landscape and system evolution.

## Risk Statement

Failure to develop a comprehensive SSP can result in inadequate documentation and security controls, leading to increased vulnerability to cyber threats and non-compliance with regulatory requirements.
