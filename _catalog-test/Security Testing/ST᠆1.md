# ST-1: Vulnerability Assessment

* **Group:** [Security Testing](/catalog/st)

## Control Statement

Run [st-1_prm_1] vulnerability assessment scans for eligible hosts.

## Control Recommendations

Select agent-based or network-based scans as necessary. Use scanners such as Amazon Inspector that support continuous scanning. Use authenticated scans for greater coverage.

## Risk Statement

Without regular vulnerability assessment scans, hosts remain exposed to undetected security vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of exploitation and unauthorised access to critical systems.



### Parameters

| ID | Type | Description |
| -- | ---- | ----------- |
| st-1_prm_1 | type | The time period of vulnerability assessment scanning. |
