# ST-4: Penetration Testing

* **Group:** [Security Testing](/catalog/st)

## Control Statement

Conduct and document a penetration test by internal teams or independent external parties every [st-4_prm_1] day(s).

## Control Recommendations

A white-box penetration test should be performed to effectively test the application.

## Risk Statement

Without conducting and documenting penetration tests, there&#39;s an increased risk of undetected security weaknesses, leaving the application susceptible to exploitation, data breaches, and unauthorised access.



### Parameters
