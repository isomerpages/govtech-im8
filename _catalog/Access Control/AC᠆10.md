# AC-10: Identity and Device-Based Access Control

* **Group:** [Access Control](/catalog/ac)

## Control Statement

Adopt Identity and Device-Based Access Control for secure and context-aware connectivity to private organisational resources.

## Control Recommendations

Use solutions such as Secure Service Edge (SSE), Identity Aware Proxies (IAP) or other Zero Trust services (Entra ID Conditional Access, Okta Device Trust, etc) that integrate identity and device management systems to provide granular access control to resources based on user identity and device posture.

## Risk Statement

Relying on direct connections or traditional VPNs for remote access can lead to vulnerabilities, as they do not always incorporate strong identity and device-based security measures. This increases the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
