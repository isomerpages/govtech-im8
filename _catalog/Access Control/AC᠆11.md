# AC-11: Single User Endpoints

* **Group:** [Access Control](/catalog/ac)

## Control Statement

Assign each endpoint device to a single designated primary user and enforce the assignment to ensure accountability and enhance security monitoring.

## Control Recommendations

Implement measures such as user authentication and endpoint management with device enrollment to enforce the single primary user per endpoint. If secondary accounts for local device support or maintenance activities consider securing with endpoint privilege management tools.

## Risk Statement

Allowing multiple users to access a single endpoint device can lead to security risks such as data leakage, difficulty in tracking user activities, and increased vulnerability to insider threats.
