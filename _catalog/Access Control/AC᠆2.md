# AC-2: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

* **Group:** [Access Control](/catalog/ac)

## Control Statement

Require MFA for remote developer, maintainer, or administrator access.

## Control Recommendations

Ensure that the authentication factors are different and independent of the accessing device.

## Risk Statement

Without requiring phishing-resistant Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for remote access, there is an increased risk of unauthorised access, credential theft, and potential compromise of sensitive systems, especially for users with elevated privileges.
