# AC-5: Endpoint Device Hardening

* **Group:** [Access Control](/catalog/ac)

## Control Statement

Require hardened endpoint devices for remote developer, maintainer, or administrator access.

## Control Recommendations

Use Endpoint Management platfoms such as Security Suite for Engineering Endpoint Devices (SEED) to continuously check and enforce device security posture and deny access if the hardening requirements are not met.

## Risk Statement

Without requiring hardened endpoint devices for remote access, there&#39;s an increased risk of compromised endpoints, potential malware infections, and security breaches, which could lead to unauthorised access and compromise the integrity of systems with developer, maintainer, or administrator access.
