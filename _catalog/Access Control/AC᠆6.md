# AC-6: Default Credentials

* **Group:** [Access Control](/catalog/ac)

## Control Statement

Change default credentials prior to first use.

## Control Recommendations

Identify any default credentials used in any system components before deploying and change them. Configure end-user systems to prompt for password change on first login after account creation or reset.

## Risk Statement

Failure to change default credentials prior to first use increases the risk of unauthorised access, as default credentials are often well-known and targeted by attackers, compromising the security of the system or device.
