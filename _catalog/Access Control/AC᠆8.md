# AC-8: Automate account provisioning

* **Group:** [Access Control](/catalog/ac)

## Control Statement

Implement automation of cloud and application account provisioning and deprovisioning using an account management tool.

## Control Recommendations

Adopt Single Sign-On (SSO) with just-in-time provisioning or account lifecycle management tools (such as SCIM or CAM) to assist with account management. For systems unable to use SSO, it is recommended to leverage account management lifecycle tools with HR records (such as CAM) to automatically provision and de-provision accounts.

## Risk Statement

Manual account and access provisioning can introduce errors and weaknesses, thus making access control measures ineffective and unreliable.
