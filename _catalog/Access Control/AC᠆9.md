# AC-9: Endpoint Device Management

* **Group:** [Access Control](/catalog/ac)

## Control Statement

Implement and maintain a Device Management solution to ensure the security and integrity of endpoint devices used within the organisation.

## Control Recommendations

Deploy an Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution that enables management, monitoring, and secure configuration of endpoint devices. This includes enforcing disk encryption, managing configuration, ensuring regular updates, and providing the ability to remotely wipe data in case of device loss or theft.

## Risk Statement

Unmanaged endpoint devices increase the risk of unauthorized access and potential loss of sensitive information due to the compromise of devices.
