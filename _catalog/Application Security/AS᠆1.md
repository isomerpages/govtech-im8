# AS-1: Input Validation

* **Group:** [Application Security](/catalog/as)

## Control Statement

Validate all application inputs to ensure that they match the expected type, structure, or format.

## Control Recommendations

Strictly validating inputs against a comprehensive schema prevents injection attacks caused by inserting special characters or content that would cause the application to perform incorrect operations.

## Risk Statement

Without input validation, there&#39;s a heightened risk of injection attacks, data manipulation, or system crashes due to unexpected input, potentially leading to unauthorised access or disruption of services.
