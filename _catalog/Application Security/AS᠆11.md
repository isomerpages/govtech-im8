# AS-11: Session Management

* **Group:** [Application Security](/catalog/as)

## Control Statement

Require users to re-authenticate after their session exceeds [as-11_prm_1] hour(s) or terminate the session.

## Control Recommendations

NIST SP 800-63B recommends re-authentication once per 30 days for Authenticator Assurance Level 1, 12 hours or 30 minutes inactivity for Authenticator Assurance Level 2, and 12 hours or 15 minutes inactivity for Authenticator Assurance Level 3. In addition to time period, system can consider re-authentication when roles, authenticators or credentials change or when the execution of privileged functions occurs.

## Risk Statement

Not verifying a user regularly and at suitable checkpoints could allow someone who has access to the user&#39;s account to carry out unauthorised actions.
