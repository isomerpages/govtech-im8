# AS-2: Parametrised Interfaces

* **Group:** [Application Security](/catalog/as)

## Control Statement

Use parametrised interfaces for database queries or system commands.

## Control Recommendations

Parametrised interfaces such Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries ensure that parameters used in database queries or system commands are properly sanitised and prevent injection attacks.

## Risk Statement

Failure to use parameterised interfaces increases the vulnerability to SQL injection or command injection attacks, posing a significant risk of unauthorised access, data manipulation, or even potential system compromise.
