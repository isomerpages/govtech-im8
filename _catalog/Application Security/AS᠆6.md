# AS-6: Password Salting and Hashing

* **Group:** [Application Security](/catalog/as)

## Control Statement

Store passwords as salted hashes using a password hashing scheme that is resistant to offline attacks such as those described in NIST [SP 800-63b](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b). The salt should be:
 * Generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator in accordance with industry standards;
 * At least 32 bits long; and
 * Randomly generated for each account.


## Control Recommendations

Refer to NIST [SP 800-90Ar1](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-90Ar1) for suitable pseudo-random number generators. Refer to NIST [SP 800-63b](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b) Memorized Secret Verifiers section for suitable hashing schemes, including Argon2, scrypt, and PBKDF2. For application source code, use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator function instead of an insecure one, such as crypto.randomBytes instead of Math.random in Node.js and java.security.SecureRandom.nextBytes instead of java.util.Random in Java.

## Risk Statement

Without salting and hashing, in case of a data breach, exposed passwords can be easily extracted, leading to potential compromise of user accounts and sensitive information.
