# Application Security

Controls to prevent application vulnerabilities caused by insecure coding.

## AS-1 <a name="as-1"></a>


Within the OSCAL framework, a&nbsp;**catalog**&nbsp;represents a collection of&nbsp;**controls**. The catalog model is designed to represent security and privacy controls in standardised, machine-readable formats.

These controls are catagorised into&nbsp;**profiles**&nbsp;that represent security baselines and selected for implementation in&nbsp;**system security plans**. As different system security plans have different selections of controls depending on the type and sensitivity of the systems covered, not all controls will be in use at any one time.

The IM8-lite catalog serves as a central pool of controls. Agencies can contribute to the catalog when they need to a control that does not currently exist in the catalog.
