# BR-1: Backup

* **Group:** [Backup and Recovery](/catalog/br)

## Control Statement

Regularly backup all important data and systems, and store backups in a secure and separate location.

## Control Recommendations

Use default CSP-managed backup services (e.g., AWS Backup, Azure Backup, GCP Backup and DR Service). Consider alternative backup services only when default CSP services cannot be used. Store backups and snapshots separately to primary data storage with data encrypted-at-rest.

## Risk Statement

Without regular backups stored in a secure and separate location, there is an increased risk of data loss, system failures, and extended downtime in the event of accidental deletion, hardware failures, or malicious attacks.
