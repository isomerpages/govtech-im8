# CS-1: Unique Base Container Image Tags

* **Group:** [Container Security](/catalog/cs)

## Control Statement

Use unique base container image tags instead of rolling tags.

## Control Recommendations

Avoid the `latest` tag or other common rolling tags for base images to minimise unintended changes during subsequent builds using the same instruction. A digest SHA can provide a unique identifier for the image if no tag is assigned during build time.

## Risk Statement

Using unique base container image tags instead of rolling tags reduces the risk of unintentional updates, inconsistencies, and potential security vulnerabilities in containerised environments, ensuring a more stable and secure deployment process.
