# CS-10: Container Orchestrator API Access Control

* **Group:** [Container Security](/catalog/cs)

## Control Statement

Disable public access to Container Orchestrator API endpoints from the internet.

## Control Recommendations

Restrict access to the Container Orchestrator API endpoints (such as the Kubernetes API Server) to specific address ranges or use CSP provided features such as disabling Endpoint public access and Private Clusters to disable public access.

## Risk Statement

Failure to disable public access to Container Orchestrator API endpoints from the internet increases the risk of unauthorised access, potential exploitation, and security breaches, as exposing these endpoints publicly may lead to unauthorised control and compromise of the container infrastructure.
