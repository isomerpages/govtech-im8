# CS-11: Container Workload Segmentation

* **Group:** [Container Security](/catalog/cs)

## Control Statement

Segregate container workloads to help contain attacks through isolation.

## Control Recommendations

Create Kubernetes namespaces or similar container segmentation controls to isolate different workloads, services or projects.

## Risk Statement

Without separating container workloads into namespaces, there&#39;s an increased risk of lateral movement and potential compromise, as attacks on one workload could impact others; utilising namespaces helps contain and isolate potential security incidents, enhancing overall cluster security.
