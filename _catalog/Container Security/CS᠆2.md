# CS-2: Minimal Base Container Images

* **Group:** [Container Security](/catalog/cs)

## Control Statement

Build container images with minimal base images.

## Control Recommendations

Use minimal container images such as alpine, scratch, wolfi, and distroless images as the base image to reduce attack surface.

## Risk Statement

Building container images with minimal base images reduces the attack surface, potential vulnerabilities, and resource overhead, minimising the risk of security exploits and enhancing the overall security posture of the containerised environment.
