# CS-9: Private Container Image Registries

* **Group:** [Container Security](/catalog/cs)

## Control Statement

Host built container images in private container registries.

## Control Recommendations

Use only private container registries (e.g., Amazon ECR private registry) to host container images built by the organisation as images may contain proprietary code or sensitive information.

## Risk Statement

Hosting built container images in private registries enhances security by reducing the exposure of sensitive images, minimising the risk of unauthorised access, and maintaining control over image distribution, ensuring a more secure and controlled container deployment process.
