# DP-1: Data Residency

* **Group:** [Data Protection](/catalog/dp)

## Control Statement

Enforce data residency of primary data in Singapore.

## Control Recommendations

Use the Singapore region of cloud service providers for compute and storage of primary data, such as ap-southeast-1 for AWS.

## Risk Statement

Failure to enforce data residency of primary data in Singapore may lead to legal and regulatory compliance issues, privacy concerns, and potential unauthorised access or storage of sensitive data outside the jurisdiction, increasing the risk of legal consequences and data breaches.
