# DP-2: Data at Rest Encryption

* **Group:** [Data Protection](/catalog/dp)

## Control Statement

Encrypt data at rest.

## Control Recommendations

Many CSP services encrypt data at rest by default but this should be confirmed and validated depending on service usage.

## Risk Statement

Without encrypting data at rest, there&#39;s an increased risk of unauthorised access and data exposure in the event of physical theft, unauthorised access to storage media, or compromised security controls, compromising the confidentiality of stored information.
