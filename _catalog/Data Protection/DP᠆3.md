# DP-3: Data in Transit Encryption

* **Group:** [Data Protection](/catalog/dp)

## Control Statement

Encrypt data in transit.

## Control Recommendations

While some CSP services transparently encrypt data in transit at the network layer, data at the application layer should be encrypted using protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).

## Risk Statement

Failure to encrypt data in transit increases the risk of unauthorised interception and eavesdropping, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorised access, and compromise of sensitive information during transmission.
