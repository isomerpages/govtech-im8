# LM-10: Resource Usage Monitoring and Alerting

* **Group:** [Logging and Monitoring](/catalog/lm)

## Control Statement

Configure resource usage monitoring to identify abnormal usage and send automated alerts.

## Control Recommendations

Configure Amazon CloudWatch alarms, Azure Monitor alerts, or their equivalents to identify abnormal usage such as spike in usage, access to resources during expected hours, and excessive charges.

## Risk Statement

Lack of resource usage monitoring with automated alerts increases the risk of overlooking abnormal usage patterns, potential resource abuse, and compromises in system performance, hindering the ability to proactively address issues and prevent service disruptions.
