* **Group:** [Logging and Monitoring](/catalog/lm)

## Control Statement

Subscribe and send security logs to GCSOC for central threat monitoring.

## Control Recommendations

Logs that are sent to GCC Central Logs are forwarded to GCSOC.

## Risk Statement

Failure to subscribe and send security logs to the Government Cyber Security Operations Centre (GCSOC) impedes central threat monitoring, increasing the risk of delayed or unnoticed security incidents, hindering effective response, and compromising the overall cybersecurity posture.
