# LM-15: Structured Log Formatting

* **Group:** [Logging and Monitoring](/catalog/lm)

## Control Statement

Publish logs in a consistent, structured format that aligns with industry standards for easy parsing and analysis.

## Control Recommendations

For security logs, implement or transform to OCSF (Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework), ECS (Elastic Common Schema) or similar schemas to standardize log formats for better threat detection and analysis. For operational logs, adopt OpenTelemetry or structured JSON formats to facilitate clear, structured, and efficient log analysis for system performance and diagnostics. Consistent log formatting aids in automated parsing and helps in integrating logs from various sources.

## Risk Statement

Inconsistent or unstructured log formatting can lead to difficulties in log analysis and monitoring, potentially resulting in missed critical events or delayed response to system anomalies.
