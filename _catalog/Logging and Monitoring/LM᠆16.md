# LM-16: Key Signals Monitoring

* **Group:** [Logging and Monitoring](/catalog/lm)

## Control Statement

Monitor key user-facing signals to maintain robust service health and performance.

## Control Recommendations

Implement monitoring of key signals such as latency, traffic, errors, and saturation (the 4 Golden Signals). Regularly track and analyse these indicators for proactive issue detection and resolution. Use this data to identify trends and areas for system improvement, ensuring continuous enhancement in service quality and reliability.

## Risk Statement

Inadequate monitoring of key user-facing signals such as latency, traffic, errors, and saturation can lead to suboptimal service performance, adversely impacting user experience, system efficiency, and increasing the likelihood of system failures. This oversight can significantly detract from service reliability and user satisfaction.
