# LM-17: Software delivery performance monitoring

* **Group:** [Logging and Monitoring](/catalog/lm)

## Control Statement

Measure and analyse software delivery performance to optimise development velocity and operational efficiency.

## Control Recommendations

Implement tools and processes to track Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, Change Failure Rate, and Time to Restore Service (the DORA 4 Key metrics). Use these metrics as benchmarks to drive continuous improvement in the software development and deployment process, enhancing agility, reliability, and responsiveness to changes.

## Risk Statement

Failing to measure and improve the software delivery performance can lead to inefficient development processes, reduced software quality and longer recovery times.
