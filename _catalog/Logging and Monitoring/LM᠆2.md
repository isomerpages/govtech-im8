# LM-2: Tamper-Resistant Log Storage

* **Group:** [Logging and Monitoring](/catalog/lm)

## Control Statement

Protect logs from unauthorised access, modification, and deletion.

## Control Recommendations

Apply access control policies to logs based on the principle of least privilege. As far as possible, only read access should be granted. Logs sent to GCC Central Logs are tamper-resistant.

## Risk Statement

Without protection measures, logs are susceptible to unauthorised access, modification, or deletion, leading to the risk of tampering, loss of crucial audit information, and compromised forensic analysis capabilities during security incidents.
