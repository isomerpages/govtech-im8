# LM-3: Network Flow Logging

* **Group:** [Logging and Monitoring](/catalog/lm)

## Control Statement

Log network traffic going to and from network interfaces.

## Control Recommendations

Enable VPC Flow Logs for AWS or its equivalents.

## Risk Statement

Failing to log network traffic going to and from network interfaces increases the risk of overlooking suspicious activities, potential security breaches, and the inability to trace and investigate network-related incidents effectively.
