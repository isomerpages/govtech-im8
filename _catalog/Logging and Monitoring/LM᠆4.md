# LM-4: Cloud Management Event Logging

* **Group:** [Logging and Monitoring](/catalog/lm)

## Control Statement

Log management and audit events on cloud resources.

## Control Recommendations

Configure CloudTrail for AWS or its equivalents to log management and audit events such as changes to IAM policies and resources.

## Risk Statement

Neglecting to log and manage audit events on cloud resources increases the risk of undetected security incidents, compromises visibility into system activities, and hinders effective forensic analysis and compliance monitoring in cloud environments.
