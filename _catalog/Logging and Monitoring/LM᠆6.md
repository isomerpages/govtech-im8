# LM-6: Access Logging

* **Group:** [Logging and Monitoring](/catalog/lm)

## Control Statement

Log access requests sent to web application firewalls, load balancers, proxies or web servers.

## Control Recommendations

Enable AWS WAF logging, Application Load Balancer logging, API Gateways, or their equivalents.

## Risk Statement

Failure to log access requests sent to web application firewalls, load balancers, proxies, or web servers increases the risk of overlooking potential security threats, unauthorised access attempts, and compromises visibility into the traffic that could lead to security incidents.
