# NS-1: Public and Private Subnet Segmentation

* **Group:** [Network Security](/catalog/ns)

## Control Statement

Place private resources (e.g., databases) in private subnets and public resources (e.g., reverse proxies, web servers) in public subnets within a virtual network.

## Control Recommendations

This control does not apply to serverless resources (API Gateways), static sites or assets fronted by CDNs (e.g., CloudFlare, CloudFront) which are located outside of the virtual network. Private subnets do not allow direct connections from the internet while public subnets do. However, resources in private segments can connect to the internet via NAT Gateways in public subnets in the same virtual network.

## Risk Statement

Failure to segregate private and public resources within distinct subnets in a virtual network increases the risk of unauthorised access to sensitive data, as private resources may be exposed to the public internet, compromising the overall security of the infrastructure.
