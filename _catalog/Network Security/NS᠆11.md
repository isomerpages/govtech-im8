# NS-11: Alerts on changes to firewall

* **Group:** [Network Security](/catalog/ns)

## Control Statement

Generate alerts to inform appointed administrators on changes to firewall rules, including the enabling or disabling of rules.

## Control Recommendations

Implement real time alerts to inform administrators of creation, deletion, modification, enabling and disabling of firewall rules. Also alert administrators when unusual or sudden spike/drop in utilisation of firewall&#39;s system resources.

## Risk Statement

Any unintended changes to firewall rules can significantly lower the perimeter defence of a network.
