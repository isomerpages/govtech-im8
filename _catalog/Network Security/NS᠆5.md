# NS-5: Network and Application Layer Filtering

* **Group:** [Network Security](/catalog/ns)

## Control Statement

Filter direct traffic from the internet to protect against network and application layer attacks.

## Control Recommendations

Deploy the following as required:

* Web Application Firewall

* Distributed Denial of Service Protection (e.g., AWS Shield)

* Content Delivery Network (e.g., CloudFront)

## Risk Statement

Lack of filtering for direct traffic from the internet exposes the system to the risk of network and application layer attacks, increasing the likelihood of unauthorised access, denial-of-service incidents, and compromise of sensitive data.
