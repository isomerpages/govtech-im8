# SD-1: Push Protection for Secrets

* **Group:** [Secure Development](/catalog/sd)

## Control Statement

Configure the code repository to prevent secrets from being pushed to the repository.

## Control Recommendations

Use GitLab&#39;s push rules or GitHub&#39;s push protection to reject secrets on push.

## Risk Statement

Failure to configure the code repository to prevent secrets from being pushed introduces the risk of inadvertent exposure, unauthorised access, and potential misuse of sensitive information, compromising the security of the codebase and associated systems.
