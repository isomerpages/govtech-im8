# PM-2: Project Cybersecurity Risk Assessment

* **Group:** [Security Programme Management](/catalog/pm)

## Control Statement

Develop and document a project-level cybersecurity risk assessment prior to initial full release that includes:
 * Risk scenario;
 * Likelihood (from 1-5);
 * Impact (from 1-5);
 * Risk Level (Likelihood * Impact; 1-4: Low, 5-9: Medium, 10-14: Medium High, 15-19: High, 20-25: Critical)
 * Mitigating Measures


## Control Recommendations

Refer to the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore [Cybersecurity Toolkit for IT Teams](https://www.csa.gov.sg/our-programmes/support-for-enterprises/sg-cyber-safe-programme/cybersecurity-toolkits/cybersecurity-toolkit-for-it-teams) for an example of a risk assessment template and modify accordingly. For potential risk scenarios, consider examples from the Government Commercial Cloud [Cloud Security Risk Register](https://cloudplaybook.in.tech.gov.sg/confluence/display/CPP/3%29+Cloud+Security+Risk+Assessment).

## Risk Statement

Without developing and documenting a project-level cybersecurity risk assessment before the initial full release, there&#39;s an increased risk of overlooking potential security threats, vulnerabilities, and regulatory compliance issues, compromising the overall security posture of the project.
