# PM-5: Central Submission of Approved System Security Plan (SSP)

* **Group:** [Security Programme Management](/catalog/pm)

## Control Statement

Submit approved SSPs centrally to maintain a unified and up-to-date repository of security plans and practices.

## Control Recommendations

Reference the IM8 Portal for submitting all approved SSPs.

## Risk Statement

Inconsistent or decentralised submission of the SSP can lead to decreased visibility of security and compliance adoption across Government.
