# PM-6: System Documentation

* **Group:** [Security Programme Management](/catalog/pm)

## Control Statement

Maintain detailed, up-to-date documentation of all system information and architecture.

## Control Recommendations

Example system documentation includes architecture and network diagrams, architecture decision records, hardware and software inventories, data flows, and configurations. This documentation should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in the environment. Documentation should be accessible to relevant personnel while ensuring sensitive information is protected. Adopt documentation-as-code practices and machine-readable formats (such as Markdown, JSON, YAML, etc), to facilitate version control, collaboration, and automation in maintaining documentation.

## Risk Statement

Comprehensive documentation of system architecture, components, configurations, and dependencies is essential for effective management, troubleshooting, and security auditing.
