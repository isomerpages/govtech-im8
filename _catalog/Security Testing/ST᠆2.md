# ST-2: Cloud Security Posture Management

* **Group:** [Security Testing](/catalog/st)

## Control Statement

Set up cloud security posture management that performs continuous configuration scans on cloud assets.

## Control Recommendations

Use cloud security posture management tools such as CloudSCAPE, AWS Security Hub, and Datadog Cloud Security Posture Management.

## Risk Statement

Lack of continuous configuration scans through cloud security posture management increases the risk of misconfigurations in cloud assets, leading to security vulnerabilities, data breaches, and unauthorised access.
