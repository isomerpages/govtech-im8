# ST-3: Vulnerability Disclosure Programme

* **Group:** [Security Testing](/catalog/st)

## Control Statement

Display a way to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities via the Government Vulnerability Disclosure Programme.

## Control Recommendations

Add a link to https://go.gov.sg/report-vulnerability on all pages, such as in the footer.

## Risk Statement

Publicly disclosing vulnerabilities without following a responsible disclosure process increases the risk of malicious exploitation; responsible disclosure via the Government Vulnerability Disclosure Programme ensures a coordinated and secure approach to addressing vulnerabilities.
