# SC-1: Code Repository

* **Group:** [Software Supply Chain](/catalog/sc)

## Control Statement

Manage the codebase in a central code repository with version control.

## Control Recommendations

Use common platforms such as SHIP-HATS 2.0 GitLab or equivalents.

## Risk Statement

Absence of centralised code repository and version control increases the risk of code inconsistencies, loss of code history, and difficulties in collaboration, potentially leading to errors and security vulnerabilities.
