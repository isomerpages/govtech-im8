# SC-10: Internal Code Collaboration and Sharing

* **Group:** [Software Supply Chain](/catalog/sc)

## Control Statement

Share source code within Government to enhance code quality, accelerate innovation, and improve problem-solving efficiency.

## Control Recommendations

Adopt Innersource practices for internal collaboration, utilizing platforms like SHIP-HATS GitLab to manage and share code repositories in Government. Source code should be evaluated for suitability for innersourcing, such as the use of confidential algorithms or embedded sensitive data. The Innersource guidelines published in Developers Portal provide a useful framework for code sharing.

## Risk Statement

Restricting code repositories to closed source can result in duplicated efforts, hinder collaborative learning, and lead to missed bugs or vulnerabilities.
