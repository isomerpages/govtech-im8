# SC-3: Peer Review

* **Group:** [Software Supply Chain](/catalog/sc)

## Control Statement

Require peer review and approval by a designated reviewer before merging into the default branch.

## Control Recommendations

Use GitLab&#39;s protected branch and merge request settings, GitHub&#39;s branch protection settings or similar code repository controls to enforce this.

## Risk Statement

Without peer review and approval before merging, there is an increased risk of introducing undetected coding errors, security vulnerabilities, and maintaining codebase consistency may become challenging.
