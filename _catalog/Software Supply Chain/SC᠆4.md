# SC-4: Dependency Manifest Version Pinning

* **Group:** [Software Supply Chain](/catalog/sc)

## Control Statement

Pin direct and transitive dependency versions in the application&#39;s dependency manifest.

## Control Recommendations

Dependency manifests such as package-lock.json for npm and Pipfile.lock for pipenv allow you to pin dependency versions.

## Risk Statement

Failure to pin direct and transitive dependency versions in the application&#39;s manifest may lead to version drift, introducing compatibility issues, security vulnerabilities, and unpredictability in the software environment.
