# SC-5: Software Composition Analysis

* **Group:** [Software Supply Chain](/catalog/sc)

## Control Statement

Perform regular software composition analysis of application code that can be exported as a software bill of materials (SBOM).

## Control Recommendations

Software composition analysis can be performed using tools such as Gitlab, Nexus IQ, or their equivalent, with output in a common SBOM format such as SPDX or CycloneDX.

## Risk Statement

Without regular software composition analysis, the risk of using outdated or vulnerable third-party components in the application increases, potentially exposing it to security exploits.
