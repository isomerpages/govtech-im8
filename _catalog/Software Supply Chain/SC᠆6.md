# SC-6: Automated Build and Deploy

* **Group:** [Software Supply Chain](/catalog/sc)

## Control Statement

Provision and operate systems in a consistent manner using automation.

## Control Recommendations

Deploy and maintain Infrastructure and Applications with automated and repeatable tools such as CI/CD Pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and other scripts. Automated build and deploy pipelines allow for signing and validation of build artefacts. Do not make manual changes directly into production systems.

## Risk Statement

Inconsistent system provisioning and operation, without automation, may lead to configuration drift, increased likelihood of errors, and heightened vulnerability to security breaches due to manual misconfigurations.
