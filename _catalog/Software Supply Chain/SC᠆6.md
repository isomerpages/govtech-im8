<p># SC-6: Automated Build and Deploy</p>
<p><em> </em>*Group:** [Software Supply Chain](/catalog/sc)</p>
<p>## Control Statement</p>
<p>Provision and operate systems in a consistent manner using automation.</p>
<p>## Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Deploy and maintain Infrastructure and Applications with automated and
repeatable tools such as CI/CD Pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
and other scripts. Automated build and deploy pipelines allow for signing
and validation of build artefacts. Do not make manual changes directly
into production systems.</p>
<p>## Risk Statement</p>
<p>Inconsistent system provisioning and operation, without automation, may
lead to configuration drift, increased likelihood of errors, and heightened
vulnerability to security breaches due to manual misconfigurations.</p>
