# SC-8: Component Signing

* **Group:** [Software Supply Chain](/catalog/sc)

## Control Statement

Sign code and container images using a trusted source during build.

## Control Recommendations

Use tools or services like Cosign or AWS Signer to sign and verify code.

## Risk Statement

Unsigned code and container images pose a risk of tampering, impersonation, and the injection of malicious code during the build process, compromising the integrity and security of the deployed software.
