# SC-9: Signature Verification

* **Group:** [Software Supply Chain](/catalog/sc)

## Control Statement

Verify the signatures of code and artefacts before deployment or runtime.

## Control Recommendations

Implement a signature verification step such as a pipeline stage or Kubernetes Admission Controller.

## Risk Statement

Without verifying the signatures of code and artifacts before deployment or runtime, there&#39;s an increased risk of deploying tampered or malicious software, compromising the integrity and security of the system.
