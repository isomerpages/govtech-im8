<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This catalog lists out the <strong>same control&nbsp;requirements to government agencies and industry partners </strong>so
that both parties can work together to apply the right level of controls
for their systems.</p>
<p>The catalog consists of a&nbsp;central pool of recommended controls meant
for the following systems:
</p><ul>
  <li>Low-Risk Cloud</li>
  <li>Low-Risk On-Premises</li>
  <li>Medium-Risk Cloud</li>
	<li>High-Risk Cloud CII</li>
	<li>Digital Services (Others)</li>
	<li>Digital Services (High Impact)</li>
	<li>Sandbox</li>
</ul>

<p>The controls are expressed using Open Security Controls Assessment Language
(OSCAL) which are codified in machine-readable policy format. It enables
future automation to monitor and assess the effectiveness of technical
control implementation. Industry partners can get more info about OSCAL
<a href="https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The controls are categorised into domain areas as listed on the left.
Each control can either be a basic <strong>hygiene requirement</strong> which
should be implemented or a <strong>guideline</strong> which is best practice
for consideration.&nbsp; A control can be tagged as requirement for low-risk
systems but tagged as guideline for systems in sandbox stage. The list
of controls for these profiles are listed <a href="/about-ssp/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. You may refer to sample JSON files
<a href="https://github.com/GovtechSG/tech-standards" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Each system is to define a system security plan that comprises the implementable
controls.&nbsp; Agencies and their industry partners are to apply the controls
identified for each system.</p>
<p>The recommended controls for Low to High-Risk Cloud, Low-Risk On-Premises, Digital Services and Sandbox systems are published here and will progressively be updated in this website.</p>
<p>We invite the industry players to join us in the ICT&amp;SS Reform journey.
