## Purpose


This catalog consists of a <strong>central pool of recommended controls meant for low-risk systems</strong>. They are categorised into profiles (as listed on the left) that represent security baselines for selection and implementation in each system security plan.

A system security plan has different selections of controls depending on the risk tolerance, type and sensitivity of the system. Agencies will determine the controls required based on the nature of each system.
