## Purpose

  

This catalog lists out the <strong>same control&nbsp;requirements to government agencies and industry partners </strong>so that both parties can work together to apply the right level of controls for their systems.

The catalog consists of a&nbsp;central pool of recommended controls meant for low-risk systems&nbsp;that have no disruptive impact to agencyâ€™s core function or Whole-of-Government.

The controls are expressed using Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) which are codified in machine-readable policy format. It enables future automation to monitor and assess the effectiveness of technical control implementation. Industry partners can get more info about OSCAL [here](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/).

The controls are categorised into domain areas as listed on the left. Each control can either be a basic <strong>hygiene requirement</strong> which should be implemented or a <strong>guideline</strong> which is best practice for consideration.&nbsp; A control can be tagged as requirement for low-risk systems but tagged as guideline for systems in sandbox stage. The list of controls for these 2 profiles are listed <a href="/profile/low-risk/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.  You may refer to sample JSON files [Sample JSON files](https://info.standards.tech.gov.sg/control-catalog/)here.

Each system is to define a system security plan that comprises the implementable controls.&nbsp; Agencies and their industry partners are to apply the controls identified for each system.

The first tranche of recommended controls for low-risk systems are published here and will progressively be updated in this website.

We invite the industry players to join us in the ICT&amp;SS Reform journey. For&nbsp; any feedback, please provide [here.](https://go.gov.sg/ictpolicy)
