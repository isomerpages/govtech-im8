<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This catalog lists out the <strong>same control&nbsp;requirements to government agencies and industry partners </strong>so
that both parties can work together to apply the right level of controls
for their systems.</p>
<p>The catalog consists of a&nbsp;central pool of recommended controls meant
for low-risk systems&nbsp;that have no disruptive impact to agencyâ€™s core
function or Whole-of-Government.</p>
<p>The controls are expressed using Open Security Controls Assessment Language
(OSCAL) which are codified in machine-readable policy format. It enables
future automation to monitor and assess the effectiveness of technical
control implementation. Industry partners can get more info about OSCAL
<a href="https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The controls are categorised into domain areas as listed on the left.
Each control can either be a basic <strong>hygiene requirement</strong> which
should be implemented or a <strong>guideline</strong> which is best practice
for consideration.&nbsp; A control can be tagged as requirement for low-risk
systems but tagged as guideline for systems in sandbox stage. The list
of system security plans are listed <a href="folders/system-security-plan" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">system security plan</a>. You may refer
to sample JSON files <a href="https://github.com/GovtechSG/tech-standards" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Each system is to define a system security plan that comprises the implementable
controls.&nbsp; Agencies and their industry partners are to apply the controls
identified for each system.</p>
<p>The recommended controls for low-risk systems and medium-risk cloud systems
are published here and will progressively be updated in this website.</p>
<p>We invite the industry players to join us in the ICT&amp;SS Reform journey.
