## Purpose


This catalog consists of a <strong>central pool of recommended controls meant for low-risk systems</strong> that has no disruptive impact to Agencyâ€™s core function or Whole-of-Government. 

They are categorised into profiles (as listed on the left) that represent security baselines for selection and implementation in each system security plan.

A system security plan has different selections of controls depending on the risk tolerance, type and sensitivity of the system. Agencies will assess the risks and apply the right level of controls for their systems based on various business and technical considerations.
