## Purpose

  

This catalog publication is to provide the <strong>same control&nbsp;requirements to government agencies and industry partners </strong>so that both parties can work together to apply the right level of controls for their systems.

The catalog consists of a&nbsp;central pool of recommended controls meant for low-risk systems&nbsp;that has no disruptive impact to agencyâ€™s core function or Whole-of-Government.

The controls are expressed using Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) which are codified in machine-readable policy format. It enables future automation to monitor and assess the effectiveness of technical control implementation. Industry partners can get more info about OSCAL [here](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/).

The controls are categorised into groups (as listed on the left) that represent security baselines for selection and implementation in each system security plan.

Each system is to define a system security plan that comprises the implementable controls.&nbsp; Agencies and their industry partners are to apply the controls identified for each system.

The first tranche of recommended controls for low-risk systems are published here and will progressively be updated in this website.

We invite the industry players to join us in the ICT&amp;SS Reform journey. For&nbsp; any feedback, please provide [here](go.gov.sg/ictpolicy)
