## Purpose


This catalog consists of a central pool of controls meant for low-risk systems. They are categorised into profiles that represent security baselines for selection and implementation in system security plans.

Each system security plan have different selections of controls depending on the type and sensitivity of the system. Agencies will determine the controls required based on the nature of their systems.
