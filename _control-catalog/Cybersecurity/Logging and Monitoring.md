## LM-1: Separate Log Storage

**Group:** Logging and Monitoring

### Control Statement

Store logs in a different system or system component than the system component that generated the logs.

### Control Recommendations

Do not store logs only in the same system component that generated it. For example, an application server on EC2 or ECS should send logs to a separate storage such as an S3 bucket as soon as possible after the logged event instead of only storing it on the server. For cloud audit logs, store them in a separate system or account.

### Risk Statement

Storing logs in a repository separate from the system component reduces the risk of tampering, unauthorised access, and manipulation of logs if the system component is compromised.

## LM-2: Tamper-Resistant Log Storage

**Group:** Logging and Monitoring

### Control Statement

Protect logs from unauthorised access, modification, and deletion.

### Control Recommendations

Apply access control policies to logs based on the principle of least privilege. As far as possible, only read access should be granted. Logs sent to GCC Central Logs are tamper-resistant.

### Risk Statement

Without protection measures, logs are susceptible to unauthorised access, modification, or deletion, leading to the risk of tampering, loss of crucial audit information, and compromised forensic analysis capabilities during security incidents.

## LM-3: Network Flow Logging

**Group:** Logging and Monitoring

### Control Statement

Log network traffic going to and from network interfaces.

Neglecting to log security events on hosts increases the risk of undetected security incidents, compromises incident response capabilities, and hinders forensic analysis, limiting the ability to identify and mitigate potential threats.

## LM-8: Security Log Retention

**Group:** Logging and Monitoring

### Control Statement

Retain security logs for at least [ insert: param, lm-8_prm_1 ] day(s).

### Control Recommendations

Security logs include network flow logs, cloud management logs, access logs, database logs and host logs. Retain non-security logs (e.g. application, operations and performance logs) as long as needed for incident resolution and debugging. Consider log lifecycle management automation, such as Amazon S3 Lifecycle configurations.

### Risk Statement

Failure to retain security logs increases the risk of losing crucial historical data, hindering investigations, compliance audits, and the ability to identify and respond to security incidents that occurred beyond a limited timeframe.

### Parameters

| ID         | Type                     | Description                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| lm-8_prm_1 | time period (days) (int) | The time period in days of log retention. |

## LM-9: Security Monitoring and Alerting

**Group:** Logging and Monitoring

### Control Statement

Configure security monitoring to identify potential security violations or breaches and send automated alerts, and respond to them accordingly.

### Control Recommendations

Enable Amazon GuardDuty, Microsoft Azure Security Center, or their equivalents.

### Risk Statement

Without configuring security monitoring to identify potential security violations or breaches and send automated alerts, there&#39;s an increased risk of delayed or unnoticed security incidents, hindering timely response and mitigation efforts to protect the system from further compromise.

## LM-10: Resource Usage Monitoring and Alerting

**Group:** Logging and Monitoring

### Control Statement

Configure resource usage monitoring to identify abnormal usage and send automated alerts.

### Control Recommendations

Configure Amazon CloudWatch alarms, Azure Monitor alerts, or their equivalents to identify abnormal usage such as spike in usage, access to resources during unexpected hours, and excessive charges.

### Risk Statement

Lack of resource usage monitoring with automated alerts increases the risk of overlooking abnormal usage patterns, potential resource abuse, and compromises in system performance, hindering the ability to proactively address issues and prevent service disruptions.

## LM-11: Service Level Monitoring and Alerting

**Group:** Logging and Monitoring

### Control Statement

Monitor, maintain and alert on service level objectives (SLOs) and indicators (SLIs) to ensure consistent service performance, availability and reliability.

### Control Recommendations

Implement a comprehensive monitoring system that tracks key SLIs and evaluates them against defined SLOs. This will help in identifying potential service level breaches early and take proactive measures to maintain service quality. Examples include CloudWatch metrics and alerts, Amazon Route 53 health checks, Azure Monitor Application Insights, or their equivalents.

### Risk Statement

Without effective service level monitoring to identify potential application or service degradation and send automated alerts, there is a risk of failing to meet service availability standards, which could result in user dissatisfaction and reduced reliability.

## LM-12: Central Security Log Management and Monitoring

**Group:** Logging and Monitoring

### Control Statement

Centralise security log management and monitoring with [ insert: param, lm-12_prm_1 ].

### Control Recommendations

Tenants on Government Commercial Cloud (GCC) already have Cloud Service Provider (CSP) tenant security logs stored centrally and available for forwarding to Government Cyber Security Operations Centre (GCSOC). Contact GCSOC for subscription and additional services.

### Risk Statement

Lack of central security log management and monitoring increases the risk of delayed or unnoticed security incidents, hindering effective response, and compromising the overall cybersecurity posture.

### Parameters

## LM-15: Structured Log Formatting

**Group:** Logging and Monitoring

### Control Statement

Publish logs in a consistent, structured format that aligns with industry standards for easy parsing and analysis.

### Control Recommendations

For security logs, implement or transform to OCSF (Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework), ECS (Elastic Common Schema) or similar schemas to standardise log formats for better threat detection and analysis. For operational logs, adopt OpenTelemetry or structured JSON formats to facilitate clear, structured, and efficient log analysis for system performance and diagnostics. Consistent log formatting aids in automated parsing and helps in integrating logs from various sources.

### Risk Statement

Inconsistent or unstructured log formatting can lead to difficulties in log analysis and monitoring, potentially resulting in missed critical events or delayed response to system anomalies.

## LM-16: Key Signals Monitoring

**Group:** Logging and Monitoring

### Control Statement

Monitor key user-facing signals to maintain robust service health and performance.

### Control Recommendations

Implement monitoring of key signals such as latency, traffic, errors, and saturation (the 4 Golden Signals). Regularly track and analyse these indicators for proactive issue detection and resolution. Use this data to identify trends and areas for system improvement, ensuring continuous enhancement in service quality and reliability.

### Risk Statement

Inadequate monitoring of key user-facing signals such as latency, traffic, errors, and saturation can lead to suboptimal service performance, adversely impacting user experience, system efficiency, and increasing the likelihood of system failures. This oversight can significantly detract from service reliability and user satisfaction.

## LM-17: Software delivery performance monitoring

**Group:** Logging and Monitoring

### Control Statement
