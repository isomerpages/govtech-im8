As the Singapore Government's digitalisation efforts continue to grow, agencies must continue to uphold the security of their systems and data. At the same time, cybersecurity standards must continue to evolve with the latest developments in technology and adopt a risk-based approach.

The Cybersecurity Control Catalog applies established international standards and guidelines to the Singapore Government's context. Risk-based options are built into control parameters, enabling agencies to adapt controls to best fit their operating context.

Government agencies and their industry partners engaged in the design, development, or delivery of government digital services are expected to understand and apply the relevant Cybersecurity requirements. Adherence to these standards is essential for delivering secure and reliable digital services that align with the Governmentâ€™s digital transformation objectives.
