## BD-1: Responsive Web Design

**Group:** Baseline Design Practices

### Control Statement

Adopt Responsive Web Design for web-based digital services.

If specific content is deemed unsuitable for mobile devices, disable mobile device access, and clearly explain why the content or service is disabled and how it can be accessed.

### Control Recommendations

Implement Responsive Web Design techniques to ensure web-based digital services are optimised for various devices and screen sizes. Test and resolve any layout or functionality issues.

### Rationale

A significant amount of web traffic comes from mobile devices. Responsive Web Design allows for optimised browsing experience on devices with different screen sizes.

## BD-2: Site Search

**Group:** Baseline Design Practices

### Control Statement

Provide a site search function for multi-page websites.

### Control Recommendations

Implement a site search function like SearchSG. Make it easily accessible and discoverable. Regularly review search analytics to optimise the search functionality based on user behaviour and needs.

Not required for

a) Mobile applications

b) Transactional services

c) Websites where search is the service offered (e.g. CDCGoWhere).

### Rationale

Search is a known and effective alternative to navigation for users who know what they are looking for.

## BD-3: Support multiple languages

**Group:** Baseline Design Practices

### Control Statement

Provide content in multiple languages to accommodate language preferences.

### Control Recommendations

Implement language selection mechanisms at key entry points, such as login or homepage, or select language based on device setting. Ensure that end users can easily switch between languages at any time.

### Rationale

Allowing end users to select their preferred language enhances usability and inclusivity, allowing broader access and understanding.

## BD-4: Clear and Concise Content

**Group:** Baseline Design Practices

### Control Statement

Write in a clear and concise manner that is easy to read and understand; Choose simple words that most people can understand.

### Control Recommendations

Conduct user testing to validate that content is clear and accessible to your target audience.

Readability formulas such as Flesch Reading Ease or Flesch-Kincaid grade level provide an indication of the difficulty of text and identify areas for simplification.

### Rationale

Writing in a simple and concise manner allows more users with different backgrounds and language proficiency to understand your content.

## BD-5: Search Engine Optimisation

**Group:** Baseline Design Practices

### Control Statement

Implement Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) best practices to improve website search engine rankings and results.

### Control Recommendations

Fill out all metadata fields and optimise your website&#39;s meta tags. Check that information presented on the search engine results page such as page titles and abstracts are informative and relevant.

Not required for digital services that are restricted to a specific audience and accessed directly, and experimental or beta services.

### Rationale

SEO increases the findability and reach of web content by helping search platforms effectively crawl your content and optimising the content displayed in search listings. Good SEO practices are essential for end users who access your pages via search.

## BD-6: Consistent UI Design

**Group:** Baseline Design Practices

### Control Statement

Use a design system or style guide to maintain a consistent user interface design throughout the entire service.

### Control Recommendations

Use a design system such as the Singapore Government Design System (SGDS).

### Rationale

Consistent design and placement of interface components improves usability by allowing end users to quickly learn interface patterns. Design systems or style guides help with consistency and scalability by consolidating reusable designs and components.

## BD-7: Mandatory and Optional Fields

**Group:** Baseline Design Practices

### Control Statement

Indicate if input fields are mandatory or optional.

### Control Recommendations

Use consistent visual indicators, such as asterisks (\*) for mandatory fields. Providing an &#39;optional&#39; label for optional fields is a good alternative if majority of the fields are mandatory. Ensure these indicators are accessible to screen readers.

Not required for login pages asking for unique identifier (username) and password.

### Rationale

Reduces completion time by allowing end users to skip unnecessary fields and increases completion rates by helping end users understand the effort required.

## BD-8: Log-in Indication

**Group:** Baseline Design Practices

### Control Statement

Prominently display the name or identifier of the individual associated with the account after login.

### Control Recommendations

Display the end user&#39;s name or identifier in a clear, accessible location, such as the header or near the top of the page.

### Rationale

Provides a clear indication that the end user is logged into the right account. This is especially important for shared devices.

## BD-9: Contact Channels

**Group:** Baseline Design Practices

### Control Statement

Provide at least one contact channel for help or assistance.

### Control Recommendations

Implement contact channels such as phone numbers, email, contact forms, live chat.

TL-4: Official Government Footer requires a link to contact channels within the footer and WU-9: Consistent Help requires consistent placement of help and support mechanisms across pages.

### Rationale

Allow end users to contact the relevant parties if they require help or assistance. Reassures users by providing a clear method to acquire information or resolve issues.
