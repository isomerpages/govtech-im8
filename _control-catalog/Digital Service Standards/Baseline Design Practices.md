<p>## BD-1: Responsive Web Design</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Baseline Design Practices</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Adopt Responsive Web Design for web-based digital services.</p>
<p>If specific content is deemed unsuitable for mobile devices, disable mobile
device access, and clearly explain why the content or service is disabled
and how it can be accessed.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Implement Responsive Web Design techniques to ensure web-based digital
services are optimised for various devices and screen sizes. Test and resolve
any layout or functionality issues.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>A significant amount of web traffic comes from mobile devices. Responsive
Web Design allows for optimised browsing experience on devices with different
screen sizes.</p>
<p>## BD-2: Site Search</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Baseline Design Practices</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Provide a site search function for multi-page websites.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Implement a site search function like SearchSG. Make it easily accessible
and discoverable. Regularly review search analytics to optimise the search
functionality based on user behaviour and needs.</p>
<p>Not required for</p>
<p>a) Mobile applications</p>
<p>b) Transactional services</p>
<p>c) Websites where search is the service offered (e.g. CDCGoWhere).</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Search is a known and effective alternative to navigation for users who
know what they are looking for.</p>
<p>## BD-3: Support multiple languages</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Baseline Design Practices</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Provide content in multiple languages to accommodate language preferences.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Implement language selection mechanisms at key entry points, such as login
or homepage, or select language based on device setting. Ensure that end
users can easily switch between languages at any time.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Allowing end users to select their preferred language enhances usability
and inclusivity, allowing broader access and understanding.</p>
<p>## BD-4: Clear and Concise Content</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Baseline Design Practices</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Write in a clear and concise manner that is easy to read and understand;
Choose simple words that most people can understand.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Conduct user testing to validate that content is clear and accessible
to your target audience.</p>
<p>Readability formulas such as Flesch Reading Ease or Flesch-Kincaid grade
level provide an indication of the difficulty of text and identify areas
for simplification.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Writing in a simple and concise manner allows more users with different
backgrounds and language proficiency to understand your content.</p>

<p>## BD-5: Search Engine Optimisation</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Baseline Design Practices</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Implement Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) best practices to improve website
search engine rankings and results.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Fill out all metadata fields and optimise your website&amp;#39;s meta
tags. Check that information presented on the search engine results page
such as page titles and abstracts are informative and relevant.</p>
<p>Not required for digital services that are restricted to a specific audience
and accessed directly, and experimental or beta services.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>SEO increases the findability and reach of web content by helping search
platforms effectively crawl your content and optimising the content displayed
in search listings. Good SEO practices are essential for end users who
access your pages via search.</p>

<p>## BD-6: Consistent UI Design</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Baseline Design Practices</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Use a design system or style guide to maintain a consistent user interface
design throughout the entire service.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Use a design system such as the Singapore Government Design System (SGDS).</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Consistent design and placement of interface components improves usability
by allowing end users to quickly learn interface patterns. Design systems
or style guides help with consistency and scalability by consolidating
reusable designs and components.</p>
<p>## BD-7: Mandatory and Optional Fields</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Baseline Design Practices</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Indicate if input fields are mandatory or optional.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Use consistent visual indicators, such as asterisks (\*) for mandatory
fields. Providing an &amp;#39;optional&amp;#39; label for optional fields
is a good alternative if majority of the fields are mandatory. Ensure these
indicators are accessible to screen readers.</p>
<p>Not required for login pages asking for unique identifier (username) and
password.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Reduces completion time by allowing end users to skip unnecessary fields
and increases completion rates by helping end users understand the effort
required.</p>
<p>## BD-8: Log-in Indication</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Baseline Design Practices</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Prominently display the name or identifier of the individual associated
with the account after login.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Display the end user&amp;#39;s name or identifier in a clear, accessible
location, such as the header or near the top of the page.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Provides a clear indication that the end user is logged into the right
account. This is especially important for shared devices.</p>
<p>## BD-9: Contact Channels</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Baseline Design Practices</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Provide at least one contact channel for help or assistance.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Implement contact channels such as phone numbers, email, contact forms,
live chat.</p>
<p>TL-4: Official Government Footer requires a link to contact channels within
the footer and WU-9: Consistent Help requires consistent placement of help
and support mechanisms across pages.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Allow end users to contact the relevant parties if they require help or
assistance. Reassures users by providing a clear method to acquire information
or resolve issues.</p>
