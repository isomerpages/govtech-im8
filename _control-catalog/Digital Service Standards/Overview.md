third_nav_title: Digital Service Standards
---
Singapore’s Digital Government is advancing digitalisation with **user-centricity and empathy** at its foundation. Agencies play a critical role in delivering digital services that are accessible, inclusive, and responsive to the evolving needs of citizens.

The Digital Service Standards (DSS) establish a clear and consistent baseline for usability and accessibility across all government digital services. These standards align with international best practices, while being contextualised for Singapore’s needs through systemic user-centred policy design and a commitment to inclusive access. This includes compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Levels A and AA, to ensure services are accessible to all users, including persons with disabilities.

To ensure proportional application, the DSS are structured into two categories based on the digital service’s traffic volume:

*   Digital Service (High Impact): For services with an annual traffic volume of 1 million or more.
*   Digital Service (Others): For services with an annual traffic volume of less than 1 million.

Agencies are expected to reference and apply the relevant standards throughout the design, development, and delivery of digital services. Adherence to the DSS supports the delivery of consistent, high-quality, and citizen-centric digital experiences across Government.
