third_nav_title: Digital Service Standards
---
<p>Singapore's repertoire of digital government services is always expanding,
as government agencies are continuously identifying opportunities to improve
citizens' lives through technology. Singapore Government is committed to
embracing digitalisation with user-centricity and empathy at its core.</p>
<p>The Digital Service Standards (DSS) set the baseline for usability and
accessibility across all government digital services. These standards blend
global best practices with context-specific approaches, anchored in systemic
user-centred policy design and inclusive access. They incorporate the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Levels A and AA to ensure services
are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.</p>
<p>Government agencies and their industry partners that are engaged in the
design, development, or delivery of government digital services are expected
to understand and apply the relevant DSS requirements. Adherence to these
standards is essential for the delivery of high-quality, consistent, and
citizen-centric digital experiences that align with the Governmentâ€™s digital
transformation objectives.</p>
