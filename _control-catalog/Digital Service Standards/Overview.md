third_nav_title: Digital Service Standards
---
Singapore's repertoire of digital government services is always expanding, as government agencies are continuously identifying opportunities to improve citizens' lives through technology. Singapore’s Digital Government is committed to embracing digitalisation with user-centricity and empathy at its core.

The Digital Service Standards (DSS) set the baseline for usability and accessibility across all government digital services. These standards blend global best practices with context-specific approaches, anchored in systemic user-centred policy design and inclusive access. They incorporate the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Levels A and AA to ensure services are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

Government agencies and their industry partners that are engaged in the design, development, or delivery of government digital services are expected to understand and apply the relevant DSS requirements. Adherence to these standards is essential for the delivery of high-quality, consistent, and citizen-centric digital experiences that align with the Government’s digital transformation objectives.
