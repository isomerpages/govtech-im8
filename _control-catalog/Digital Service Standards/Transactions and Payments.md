<p>## TX-1: Digital-First Approach</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Transactions and Payments</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Design digital transactions to be fully digital from start to finish,
unless otherwise stated in legal regulations.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Avoid requiring non-digital interactions such as physical signatures,
paper-based approvals, or in-person submissions as part of a digital service.</p>
<p>Implement digital signature solutions such as Singpass, and enable common
digital payment methods like credit card and Paynow.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>A transaction that is not fully digital diminishes the convenience of
being able to transact anywhere and anytime.</p>
<p>## TX-2: Transaction Prerequisites</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Transactions and Payments</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Provide all information required to complete the transaction before the
start of the transaction.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Information to include where applicable:</p>
<p>a) Prerequisites or eligibility criteria</p>
<p>b) Estimated completion time/time range</p>
<p>c) Required documents and accepted file formats</p>
<p>d) Cost and payment modes available</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Knowing the information and documents required allows end users to assess
their readiness and ability to complete the transaction before committing
to it.</p>
<p>## TX-3: Break Down Long Transactions</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Transactions and Payments</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Break long transactions down into logical steps or sections.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Group related input fields together to reduce cognitive load and streamline
data entry.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Makes long or multi-step tasks feel more manageable.</p>
<p>## TX-4: Progress Indicators</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Transactions and Payments</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Provide progress indicators for multi-step transactions.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Use a clear and intuitive design to visually convey the process and progress.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Progress indicators can help end users estimate time required for a task,
and know their progress within a transaction or flow.</p>
<p>## TX-5: Save Draft Function</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Transactions and Payments</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Provide a save draft function for long transactions.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Ensure the option to save drafts is clearly visible and accessible. Provide
clear feedback when a draft has been saved and provide easy access to retrieve
and resume the draft.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Some transactions have long estimated completion time or many fields.
An option to save and continue later provides end users with the flexibility
of performing the transaction in chunks, and assurance that input can be
retrieved if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>## TX-6: Pre-fill Data</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Transactions and Payments</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Pre-fill forms with known data where applicable;</p>
<p>Where SingPass/CorpPass is used, provide the option to pre-fill personal
or business data with MyInfo and Enterprise Data Hub (EDH).</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Properly assess accuracy and relevance of any pre-filled data before implementation.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Pre-filled data saves end users time and minimises the risk of errors
from manual input.</p>
<p>## TX-7: Payment and Refund</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Transactions and Payments</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Provide payment and refund information before payment is made.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Ensure this information is easily accessible on the payment page and before
the start of the transaction.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Being transparent and upfront about payment related details reassures
end users and minimises the unpleasantness of rectifying an error.</p>
<p>## TX-8: Managing Stored Payment Details</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Transactions and Payments</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Allow updating and removal of stored payment details in all digital services
involving payments.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Provide clear instructions and confirmation prompts to guide end users
through the process to minimise errors.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Provides end users with control over sensitive payment information.</p>
<p>## TX-9: Success or failure message</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Transactions and Payments</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Display a success or failure message at the end of the transaction.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Use familiar and unambiguous visual cues, such as clear copy, iconography,
and colour(e.g. green for success, red for failure) to enhance immediate
recognition.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Clear feedback on the outcome of the transaction reassures end users.</p>
<p>## TX-10: Failed Transaction Details</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Transactions and Payments</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Provide the following details for failed transactions:</p>
<p>- a) Clear reasons for failure or rejection (unless limited by policy
considerations)</p>
<p>- b) Alternative actions</p>
<p>- c) Channels for appeals or further enquiries</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Ensuring explanations are clear and as detailed as possible within policy
constraints.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Providing specific and actionable information to end users when a transaction
fails allows them to quickly understand the reasons, and resolve issues
if applicable.</p>
<p>## TX-11: Payment details</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Transactions and Payments</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Display payment details once payment has been completed.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Important payment details include:</p>
<p>i) Acknowledgement code or receipt number (where applicable);</p>
<p>ii) Transaction date;</p>
<p>iii) List of products and/or services transacted (where applicable);</p>
<p>iv) Chosen digital payment mechanism (where applicable);</p>
<p>v) Amount paid</p>
<p>Payment information can be displayed on the success screen and/or sent
via other acknowledgement channels. Consider providing the option to download
or print the receipt for record-keeping.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Transactions involving payment are important to end users. Post transaction
acknowledgement serves as a secondary check and can potentially reduce
the consequences of errors.</p>
<p>## TX-12: Transaction Outcome</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Transactions and Payments</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Provide an estimated timeframe for the transaction outcome when it is
not immediately available.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>This information can be provided before the start of the transaction,
on the submission success screen, and/or in acknowledgement or receipts.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Keeping users informed about when to expect a decision reduces uncertainty
and manages user expectations.</p>
<p>## TX-13: Post-transaction Acknowledgement</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Transactions and Payments</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Send and/or allow download of an acknowledgement after a successful transaction.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Send acknowledgement via channels like SMS, email, push notification,
or in-app notifications. Ensure that the acknowledgment includes key details
about the submission.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Allowing the end user to retain a receipt or acknowledgement of the transaction
that can be revisited provides reassurance that the submission or transaction
has been received.</p>
<p>## TX-14: Transaction Status Updates</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Transactions and Payments</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Provide notifications when there are updates to transaction status.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Notifications can be sent via SMS, email, push notification, or in-app
notifications.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>An active approach of notifying end users when they are updates to their
transaction status reduces the need to manually check, and allows for timely
follow-ups.</p>
<p>## TX-15: Tracking Transaction Status</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Transactions and Payments</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Enable online tracking of transaction status.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Provide clear status labels and descriptions, estimated completion timelines,
and any required end user actions.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Allowing end users to track their transactions online increases transparency
and builds trust. The ability to self-service provides a sense of control,
reducing anxiety for users, and reducing reliance and load on customer
support.</p>
