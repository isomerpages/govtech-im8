<p>Controls to ensure services are informed by real user needs and behaviors.</p>

<p>| [UU-1: Understand user needs](#uu-1-understand-user-needs) |</p>
<p>| [UU-2: Test with users](#uu-2-test-with-users) |</p>
<p>## UU-1: Understand user needs</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Understand Users</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Understand and document Public Users&amp;#39; needs and context when creating
a new digital service, redesigning existing services or introducing major
features.</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Take steps to understand end user context, needs, and problems before
deciding on a solution.</p>
<p>This includes activities such as:</p>
<p>a) conducting user research (e.g. surveys, interviews, ethnographic studies)</p>
<p>b) analysing end user feedback</p>
<p>c) using web analytics and other relevant data.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Understanding end user context, goals, behaviour and mindsets allows you
to design solutions that truly meet their needs. Better-aligned digital
services effective meet user needs from the start, improving user satisfaction,
and reducing costly rework.</p>
<p>## UU-2: Test with users</p>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Understand Users</p>
<p>### Control Statement</p>
<p>Conduct and document usability testing with representative Public Users
when creating a new digital service, redesigning existing services or introducing
major features. Remediate or risk accept findings within [ insert: param,
uu-2_prm_1 ] day(s).</p>
<p>### Control Recommendations</p>
<p>Conduct usability testing at key milestones such as prior to public release.
Identify key end user tasks based on real scenarios and create prototypes
to test them.</p>
<p>Document findings in a structured report, prioritising issues based on
severity.</p>
<p>While structured usability testing is recommended, lightweight methods—such
as guerrilla testing with a small number of users—are acceptable if they
still yield actionable insights.</p>
<p>Usability testing is not user acceptance testing.</p>
<p>### Rationale</p>
<p>Testing with end users allows early identification of usability issues
at various points in the design and development process. This ensures the
product is intuitive and usable, and reduces the risk of costly fixes later.</p>
