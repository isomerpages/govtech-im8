The CCoP Cloud System Security Plan template includes Level 0 and Level 1 baseline controls that are recommended as the default controls for CII systems.

## System Characteristics

- **Name:** CII System
- **Description:** A generic system hosted on the cloud through a third-party Cloud Service Provider.
- **Security Sensitivity Level:** Confidential, Sensitive High

## AS: Application Security (15)

### AS-1: Input Validation

- **Group:** Application Security
- **Profile Level:** 0

#### Control Statement

Validate all application inputs to ensure that they match the expected type, structure, or format.

#### Control Recommendations

Strictly validating inputs against a comprehensive schema prevents injection attacks caused by inserting special characters or content that would cause the application to perform incorrect operations.

#### Risk Statement

Without input validation, there&#39;s a heightened risk of injection attacks, data manipulation, or system crashes due to unexpected input, potentially leading to unauthorised access or disruption of services.

### AS-2: Parameterised Interfaces

- **Group:** Application Security
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Use parameterised interfaces for database queries or system commands.

#### Control Recommendations

Parameterised interfaces such Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries ensure that parameters used in database queries or system commands are properly sanitised and prevent injection attacks.

#### Risk Statement

Failure to use parameterised interfaces increases the vulnerability to SQL injection or command injection attacks, posing a significant risk of unauthorised access, data manipulation, or even potential system compromise.

### AS-3: Output Sanitisation

- **Group:** Application Security
- **Profile Level:** 0

#### Control Statement

Sanitise all application outputs that will be used to render a HTML document.

#### Control Recommendations

Any application outputs that are returned to the requester and used to render a HTML document can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if they contain special characters that change the rendering of the HTML document by the browser.

#### Risk Statement

Lack of sanitisation for application outputs used in rendering HTML documents exposes the system to the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing malicious code execution in browsers.

### AS-4: Authentication Mechanism Rate-Limiting

- **Group:** Application Security
- **Profile Level:** 0

#### Control Statement

Apply rate-limiting on all authentication mechanisms to deter brute-force attacks.

#### Control Recommendations

Consider rate-limiting to a maximum of 3 consecutive failed authentication attempts within 15 minutes or other reasonable rate limits. Time delays between log-on attempts reduce the risk of successful brute-forcing attacks. Bot mitigation tools such as CAPTCHA can further reduce this risk.

#### Risk Statement

Without rate-limiting, there&#39;s an increased risk of unauthorised access as attackers may exploit weak credentials through repeated login attempts.

### AS-5: Password Requirements

- **Group:** Application Security
- **Profile Level:** 0

#### Control Statement

Where SSO or passwordless is not supported, verify that [as-5_prm_3] passwords are at least [as-5_prm_1] characters in length and [as-5_prm_2].

#### Control Recommendations

Latest NIST [SP 800-63B](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b) guidelines found that password length is a primary factor in determining the strength of a password while composition and complexity rules provide marginal security benefits.

#### Risk Statement

Short or commonly used passwords increase the vulnerability to unauthorised access, potentially leading to compromised accounts and unauthorised activities on the system.

#### Parameters

|ID        |Type                      |Description                      |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
|as-5_prm_1|number of characters (int)|The minimum length of a password.|
|as-5_prm_2|policy (str)              |The password policy.             |
|as-5_prm_3|type (str)                |The type of password.            |

### AS-6: Password Salting and Hashing

- **Profile Level:** 0

#### Control Statement

Store passwords as salted hashes using a password hashing scheme that is resistant to offline attacks such as those described in NIST [SP 800-63b](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b). The salt should be:

- Generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator in accordance with industry standards;
- At least 32 bits long; and
- Randomly generated for each account.

#### Control Recommendations

Refer to NIST [SP 800-90Ar1](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-90Ar1) for suitable pseudo-random number generators. Refer to NIST [SP 800-63b](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b) Memorized Secret Verifiers section for suitable hashing schemes, including Argon2, scrypt, and PBKDF2. For application source code, use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator function instead of an insecure one, such as crypto.randomBytes instead of Math.random in Node.js and java.security.SecureRandom.nextBytes instead of java.util.Random in Java.

#### Risk Statement

Without salting and hashing, in case of a data breach, exposed passwords can be easily extracted, leading to potential compromise of accounts and sensitive information.

### AS-7: Access Control Check Enforcement

- **Group:** Application Security
- **Profile Level:** 0

#### Control Statement

Perform access control checks on all authenticated requests.

#### Control Recommendations

Utilise authorisation filters or middleware to force all authenticated requests to undergo access control checks.

#### Risk Statement

### AS-8: Secrets Management

- **Group:** Application Security
- **Profile Level:** 0

#### Control Statement

Securely store secrets in an appropriate secrets management solution with access control enforcement, encryption, and monitoring.

#### Control Recommendations

Secrets include API keys, access keys, and other static credentials. Do not store secrets unencrypted in source code or configuration files. Store secrets in cloud-native solutions like AWS Secrets Manager and Azure Key Vault or cloud-agnostic solutions like HashiCorp Vault and CyberArk Conjur. For SaaS or platforms, ensure that secrets are stored in an appropriate solution. For example, use GitHub Actions secrets instead of variables.

#### Risk Statement

Exposure of sensitive information and unauthorised access to system credentials may occur if application secrets are stored insecurely or hard-coded in source code.

### AS-9: Content Security Policy (CSP)

- **Group:** Application Security
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Set minimally permissive CSP response headers to mitigate cross-site scripting attacks.

#### Control Recommendations

Utilise the relevant fetch directives such as `default-src`, `script-src`, `style-src`, `connect-src`, `img-src`, `media-src` and `object-src` to prevent loading of scripts from malicious sources. Refer to the [OWASP Secure Headers Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers) Best Practices for recommended header values.

#### Risk Statement

Without minimally permissive Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, the risk of cross-site scripting attacks, leading to unauthorised script execution and potential data theft, is increased.

Refer to the [OWASP Secure Headers Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers) Best Practices for recommended header values.

#### Risk Statement

Failure to implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) with a sufficient maximum age may expose the system to protocol downgrade attacks, compromising the security of communication channels.

### AS-11: Session Management

- **Group:** Application Security
- **Profile Level:** 0

#### Control Statement

Require [as-11_prm_2] to re-authenticate after their session exceeds [as-11_prm_1] hour(s) or terminate the session.

#### Control Recommendations

NIST SP 800-63B recommends re-authentication once per 30 days for Authenticator Assurance Level 1, 12 hours or 30 minutes inactivity for Authenticator Assurance Level 2, and 12 hours or 15 minutes inactivity for Authenticator Assurance Level 3. In addition to time period, system can consider re-authentication when roles, authenticators or credentials change or when the execution of privileged functions occurs.

#### Risk Statement

Not re-authenticating regularly and at suitable checkpoints could allow someone who has access to the account to carry out unauthorised actions.

#### Parameters

|ID         |Type                     |Description                                              |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
|as-11_prm_1|time period (hours) (int)|The maximum time period in hours of a user&#39;s session.|
|as-11_prm_2|type (str)               |The type of session.                                     |

### AS-12: Malware Scanning of Uploaded Files

## NS: Network Security (11)

### NS-1: Network and System Component Segmentation

- **Group:** Network Security
- **Profile Level:** 0

#### Control Statement

Segment and isolate system components into separate physical and logical networks or environments based on their security requirements and risk levels.

#### Control Recommendations

Deploy security controls such as firewalls, security groups, and API gateways to establish and maintain segmentation. In cloud environments, implement a tiered network architecture where internet-facing services are restricted to designated public segments, while sensitive backend systems remain in private segments with controlled outbound access. Consider micro-segmentation for granular control based on workload sensitivity.

#### Risk Statement

Failure to segregate private and public resources within distinct subnets in a virtual network increases the risk of unauthorised access to sensitive data, as private resources may be exposed to the public internet, compromising the overall security of the infrastructure.

### NS-2: Access Restrictions on CSP Resources Outside Virtual Network

- **Group:** Network Security
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Restrict access to CSP resources outside of a virtual network (e.g., Lambda, DynamoDb, API Gateways, S3, CloudFront) using access controls or application layer authorisation.

#### Control Recommendations

Apply access restrictions appropriate to the resource type. Access through interface VPC endpoints is only required if the client is hosted in a private subnet. For example:

- Restrict access to DynamoDB with IAM policies.

- Restrict access to API Gateway with Lambda authorizers or authorisation middlewares at the application layer. If the API Gateway is exposed to private subnets, create a private API.

- Restrict access to S3 Buckets with IAM policies and block public access from the internet.

#### Risk Statement

Lack of access restrictions raises the risk of unauthorised access, data exposure, and potential misuse of critical services, compromising the overall security posture.

### NS-3: Deny by Default - Allow by Exception

- **Group:** Network Security
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Deny network communications traffic by default and allow network communications traffic by exception at managed interfaces.

#### Control Recommendations

Configure network access control lists and security groups to deny all traffic by default. Only allow traffic to and from specific hosts and ports by exception. For egress traffic to the internet, consider whitelisting domains at the application layer or DNS resolver rather than just hosts or ports at the transport layer.

#### Risk Statement

Without network access controls, there&#39;s an increased risk of unauthorised or malicious network access, leading to potential security breaches and compromise of system integrity.

### NS-4: Inter-Private Network Connectivity

- **Group:** Network Security
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Route network traffic between private networks without going through the internet.

#### Control Recommendations

Use CSP Private endpoint services (e.g., AWS PrivateLink with VPC endpoints) when you want to allow one or more consumer VPCs unidirectional access to a specific service or set of instances in the service provider VPC. Otherwise, use VPC peering and Transit Gateway when you want to enable layer-3 IP connectivity between VPCs. Refer to the [Multi-VPC AWS Network Infrastructure Whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/vpc-to-vpc-connectivity.html) for further guidance.

#### Risk Statement

When routing through the internet, there&#39;s an increased risk of man-in-the-middle and spoofing attacks. Allowing bidirectional access between networks without fine-grained access controls increases the risk of unauthorised access, potential data exfiltration, and compromise of network security compared to unidirectional access to specific resources.

### NS-5: Network and Application Layer Filtering

- **Group:** Network Security
- **Profile Level:** 0

#### Control Statement

Filter direct traffic from the internet to protect against network and application layer attacks.

#### Control Recommendations

Deploy the following mechanisms as appropriate for the system and network architecture:

- Web Application Firewall

- Content Delivery Network (e.g., CloudFront)

#### Risk Statement

Lack of filtering for direct traffic from the internet exposes the system to the risk of network and application layer attacks, increasing the likelihood of unauthorised access, denial-of-service incidents, and compromise of sensitive data.

### NS-6: Valid and Trusted SSL/TLS Certificates

- **Group:** Network Security
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Ensure that deployed SSL/TLS certificates are:

- signed by a trusted root Certificate Authority;
- match the domain name of the service they are issued for;
- not expired; and
- not revoked.

#### Control Recommendations

Configure a certificate manager that auto-renews certificates and sends alerts before expiry (e.g., AWS Certificate Manager). Otherwise, automate these functions separately.

#### Risk Statement

Using invalid SSL/TLS certificates introduces the risk of compromised encryption, man-in-the-middle attacks, and potential unauthorised access to sensitive information.

### NS-7: Secure Inter-Service Communication

- **Group:** Network Security
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Ensure communications between services are secure by making them authenticated, authorised and encrypted.

#### Control Recommendations

Design and build inter-service communications (e.g., databases, microservices) to be authenticated, authorised and encrypted (e.g., via API gateways, proxies, private endpoint services, message queues, or service meshes). It is recommended to log communication (such as access logs, transaction logs or payloads) between services for detection, monitoring and investigation of incidents.

#### Risk Statement

Failure to ensure secure communications between services increases the risk of unauthorised access, data breaches, and potential manipulation of sensitive information during transit.

### NS-8: Secure Cloud and On-Premises Connectivity

- **Group:** Network Security
- **Profile Level:** 0

#### Control Statement

Route network traffic between on-premises systems and cloud systems through a secure intermediary.

#### Control Recommendations

Design and build secure communications to or from on-premises systems through a managed interface with boundary protection mechanisms rather than direct connectivity (e.g. via API gateways, application proxies or private endpoint services).

#### Risk Statement

Insecure connectivity between cloud and on-premises environments can lead to data breaches, unauthorised access, and compromise of both cloud and on-premises resources.

### NS-9: Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)/Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

- **Group:** Network Security
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Set up and configure an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)/Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in the network.

#### Control Recommendations

Configure network or host IPS/IDS to detect malicious traffic to/from public or untrusted networks.

#### Risk Statement

Absence of network or host IPS or IDS in the network increases the likelihood of undetected intrusions, putting sensitive data and system integrity at risk.

### NS-10: Private Network Connectivity

- **Group:** Network Security
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Implement strong access controls, encryption, and logging for remote developer, maintainer, or administrator access to private network resources.

#### Control Recommendations

Use strong authentication and MFA. Layered security mechanisms and controls include:

- Inspect traffic from gateway to private network;

- Terminate all remote access connections in a dedicated network segment within the network and restrict access to only systems and services allowed by the organisation;

- Implement strong encryption for remote access into internal networks;

- Only allow authorised devices to remotely access internal networks;

- Ensure that remote access connections are not perpetual and re-authenticate remote connections to the VPN gateway on a periodic basis (such as every four hours);

- Set the maximum number of consecutive failed authentication attempts before account lockout for remote access to internal networks; and

- Make sure that split tunnelling is not implemented.

#### Risk Statement

Weak private network security may expose the network to malicious activities, jeopardising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical resources.

### NS-11: Alerts on Firewall Configuration Changes

- **Group:** Network Security
- **Profile Level:** 0

#### Control Statement

Generate alerts to inform appointed administrators on changes to firewall rules, including the enabling or disabling of rules.

#### Control Recommendations

Implement real time alerts to inform administrators of creation, deletion, modification, enabling and disabling of firewall rules. Also alert administrators when unusual or sudden spike/drop in utilisation of firewall&#39;s system resources.

#### Risk Statement

Any unintended changes to firewall rules can significantly lower the perimeter defence of a network.

## BR: Backup and Recovery (6)

### BR-1: Backup

- **Group:** Backup and Recovery
- **Profile Level:** 0

#### Control Statement

Backup all important data and systems at least every [br-1_prm_1] day(s), and store backups in a secure and separate location.

#### Control Recommendations

Use default CSP-managed backup services (e.g., AWS Backup, Azure Backup, GCP Backup and DR Service). Consider alternative backup services only when default CSP services cannot be used. Store backups and snapshots separately to primary data storage with data encrypted-at-rest. For SaaS, ensure that SaaS provider is able to restore last backup.

#### Risk Statement

Without regular backups stored in a secure and separate location, there is an increased risk of data loss, system failures, and extended downtime in the event of accidental deletion, hardware failures, or malicious attacks.

#### Parameters

|ID        |Type                    |Description                        |
|----------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|br-1_prm_1|time period (days) (int)|The time period in days for backup.|

### BR-2: Recovery Testing

- **Group:** Backup and Recovery
- **Profile Level:** 0

#### Control Statement

Conduct testing of recovery processes at least every [br-2_prm_1] day(s) to ensure their effectiveness.

#### Control Recommendations

Ensure each test verifies the system&#39;s ability to fully restore all data and services.

#### Risk Statement

### HR-2: Security Screening of Employees

- **Group:** Human Resource
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Conduct security screening of employees that operate and manage the system, during their hiring phase.

#### Control Recommendations

Consider engaging reputable 3rd party screening companies to conduct background checks before extending employment offers.

#### Risk Statement

Inadequate screening may lead to the hiring of individuals with criminal histories, falsified credentials or conflicts of interest. This potentially leads to insider threats, causing damage to the organisation.

### HR-3: Employee Termination Process

- **Group:** Human Resource
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Develop and document a process for the secure termination of employees.

#### Control Recommendations

The employee termination process should include:

1. Deprovisioning accounts promptly before terminating employees to reduce opportunity for damage
2. Conducting exit interviews to ensure understanding of ongoing confidentiality obligations
3. Ensuring all issued equipment is returned and inventoried
4. Secure disposal of employee&#39;s data and removal of access rights
5. Notification to relevant stakeholders about the employee&#39;s departure and changes to contact points

#### Risk Statement

Inadequate employment termination processes can lead to unauthorised access to sensitive information due to either disgruntled employees retaining access or attackers exploiting non-disabled accounts.

## RS: Resiliency (3)

### RS-1: Multi-AZ Deployment

- **Group:** Resiliency
- **Profile Level:** 0

#### Control Statement

Deploy the system in [rs-1_prm_1] availability zones (AZs) within the region.

#### Control Recommendations

Utilise cloud-native services for load-balancing and auto-scaling across multiple AZs. Implement health checks and automated failover mechanisms to redirect traffic. Ensure data is replicated across multiple AZs.

#### Risk Statement

Failure to deploy services across multiple availability zones increases the risk of extended service outages due to a single point of failure.

#### Parameters
