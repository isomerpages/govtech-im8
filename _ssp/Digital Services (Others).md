Digital Service (also known as Government Digital Service) refers to any public service that is delivered digitally. It is used to convey the Government’s position, provide information, and/or deliver services to the public.

Digital Services (Others) refer to Digital services with less than 1 million visits per year (note: this will be determined based on WOGAA statistics).

Unlike RML High/Medium/Low-Risk systems, Digital Services will adopt a &#39;Comply or Explain&#39; approach for any deviation of DSS Level 1 controls.

## System Characteristics

- **Name:** Services System
- **Description:** A system that has services.
- **Security Sensitivity Level:** NA

## UU: Understand Users (2)

### UU-1: Understand user needs

- **Group:** Understand Users
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Understand and document Public Users&#39; needs and context when creating a new digital service, redesigning existing services or introducing major features.

#### Control Recommendations

Take steps to understand end user context, needs, and problems before deciding on a solution.

This includes activities such as:

a) conducting user research (e.g. surveys, interviews, ethnographic studies)

b) analysing end user feedback

c) using web analytics and other relevant data.

#### Rationale

Understanding end user context, goals, behaviour and mindsets allows you to design solutions that truly meet their needs. Better-aligned digital services effective meet user needs from the start, improving user satisfaction, and reducing costly rework.

### UU-2: Test with users

- **Group:** Understand Users
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Conduct and document usability testing with representative Public Users when creating a new digital service, redesigning existing services or introducing major features. Remediate or risk accept findings within [uu-2_prm_1] day(s).

#### Control Recommendations

Conduct usability testing at key milestones such as prior to public release. Identify key end user tasks based on real scenarios and create prototypes to test them.

Document findings in a structured report, prioritising issues based on severity.

While structured usability testing is recommended, lightweight methods—such as guerrilla testing with a small number of users—are acceptable if they still yield actionable insights.

Usability testing is not user acceptance testing.

#### Rationale

Testing with end users allows early identification of usability issues at various points in the design and development process. This ensures the product is intuitive and usable, and reduces the risk of costly fixes later.

#### Control Statement

Ensure text can be scaled up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.

#### Control Recommendations

Use relative units like REM. Ensure at least one one browser or platform text scaling mechanism can be used. This includes zoom (of the entire page&#39;s content), magnification, and text-only resizing. Test to confirm that no content is clipped, truncated, or obscured after resizing.

This excludes captions and images of text.

#### Rationale

Resizable text makes digital content accessible to a wide range of end users with different visual capabilities, particularly those without access to screen magnification tools.

### WP-15: Images of Text

- **Group:** WCAG - Perceivable
- **Profile Level:** 2

#### Control Statement

Use text instead of images of text.

#### Control Recommendations

Avoid using images of text except when essential, such as for logos. Where text in images are necessary, ensure that alternative text or captions provide the same information.

#### Rationale

Text in images are not accessible, especially for end users with visual impairments or reading disabilities. Users cannot adjust the size or font for better readability and the text is not readable by common screen reader technology.

### WP-16: Content Reflow

- **Group:** WCAG - Perceivable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Enable lines of text and content to reflow across different viewports.

#### Control Recommendations

Use responsive design frameworks like CSS Flexbox or Grid and test on a variety of devices to confirm that content remains legible and usable without excessive scrolling even when text is resized.

Not required for content that requires two-dimensional layout for understanding or functionality, such as maps, complex data tables or data visualisations.

#### Rationale

Enabling reflowing of content allows users who rely on large fonts, including those using devices with smaller screens to be able to view and navigate digital content without scrolling horizontally even when text size is increased.

### WP-17: Non-text Contrast

- **Group:** WCAG - Perceivable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Ensure a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 between colours of user interface components and graphical objects that convey important information, and their respective backgrounds.

#### Control Recommendations

Use tools like WebAIM&#39;s Contrast Checker to test contrast. Focus on elements critical for interaction, such as buttons and form inputs.

#### Rationale

Sufficient contrast helps end users better perceive and identify non-text user interface components and key graphical objects, improving usability.

### WP-18: Text Spacing

- **Group:** WCAG - Perceivable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Ensure that text implemented using markup languages can be adjusted to the following text style properties with no loss of content or functionality:

- a) Line height to 1.5 times the font size
- b) Paragraph spacing to 2 times the font size
- c) Letter spacing to 0.12 times the font size
- d) Word spacing to 0.16 times the font size

#### Control Recommendations

Allow for text spacing override by assistive technology and test with tools that simulate the spacing configurations specified.

Text content does not need to use these text spacing values as defaults, and there is no need to implement controls for users to adjust text properties within the digital service.

#### Rationale

Ensures that end users, in particular those with low vision or dyslexia are: a) Not restricted from overriding default text spacing through the use of assistive technology, stylesheets or extensions. b) Content or functionality is not lost and the content remains legible and functional.

### WP-19: Content on Hover or Focus

- **Group:** WCAG - Perceivable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Ensure content appearing on hover or focus

- a) Appears long enough to be read and interacted with
- b) Does not disappear unexpectedly
- c) Can be easily dismissed using a pointer device or keyboard

#### Control Recommendations

Design custom tooltips, sub-menus and other non-modal popups which display on hover and focus to be perceivable and dismissible without disrupting the overall user experience.

#### Rationale

Elements that appear on hover or focus can be difficult to manage. End users with limited motor control may have trouble keeping their pointer steady, and keyboard-only users need a reliable way to dismiss such content.

## WO: WCAG - Operable (18)

### WO-1: Keyboard equivalent

- **Group:** WCAG - Operable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Ensure any action done using a pointer device can also be done using a keyboard.

#### Control Recommendations

Provide keyboard operation for all the functionality of the page unless the function requires path-dependent input such as handwriting.

Avoid requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes such as requirements to repeat or execute multiple keystrokes within a short period of time.

#### Rationale

Ensures that there is no loss of functionality for users who rely on keyboards such as those with motor impairments.

### WO-2: No Keyboard Trap

- **Group:** WCAG - Operable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Ensure that keyboard users can move keyboard focus away or out from a component or section of the digital service.

#### Control Recommendations

Test forms, widgets, and custom elements with keyboard-only navigation to confirm end users can exit all components using standard keys (like Tab and Shift+Tab).

If the key functionality of the component restricts the focus to a subsection of the content, communicate clearly to users how to leave that state and &quot;untrap&quot; the focus.

#### Rationale

A keyboard trap happens when keyboard focus is moved to a component or subsection of the digital service without a way of the end user navigating back out using a keyboard interface. End users who who rely on exclusive keyboard interface usage such as people with vision and physical disabilities get stuck and are unable to proceed to other parts of the service or complete a critical transaction.

### WO-3: Character Key Shortcuts

- **Group:** WCAG - Operable
- **Profile Level:** 2

#### Control Statement

Provide a mechanism to disable or remap shortcuts that are activated using only one character key press.

#### Control Recommendations

If character key shortcuts are used, provide end users with the ability to disable or remap them. Implement keyboard settings within the interface for customisation, ensuring shortcuts do not interfere with common keyboard interactions.

#### Rationale

Reduces the risk of accidental activation of keyboard shortcuts for keyboard users and speech input users, whose dictation is interpreted as strings of letters.

### WO-4: Adjustable Timings

- **Group:** WCAG - Operable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Allow time limits to be turned off, adjusted, or extended.

#### Control Recommendations

Avoid time-dependent functions unless absolutely necessary. Ensure timers are non-disruptive and adjustable or extendable.

Not required when the time limit is:

a) Mandatory from a legal point of view

b) Required as part of a real-time event where extensions would invalidate the activity

c) Longer than 20 hours

#### Rationale

Persons with disabilities may need more time to complete complex tasks such as filling out lengthy grant forms. Designing functions that are not time-dependent or allow for adjustable timings will help everyone, especially people with disabilities, succeed at completing these tasks.

### WO-5: Pause, Stop, Hide

- **Group:** WCAG - Operable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Provide a function to pause, stop, hide or control the frequency of moving, blinking, scrolling or auto-updating content that occur in parallel with other content.

#### Control Recommendations

Content changes refer to, but are not exclusive to, auto-updating information, animations containing essential information or similar components.

Allow users to pause, stop, or hide content that automatically moves, blinks, scrolls or auto-updates for more than 5 seconds.

#### Rationale

Content that moves or auto-updates can be a barrier to anyone who has trouble reading stationary text quickly, tracking moving objects or noticing page changes easily. It can also cause problems for screen readers.

### WO-6: Reduce Flash Triggers

- **Group:** WCAG - Operable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Avoid content that flashes more than three times per second or provide a warning and the option to skip such content.

#### Control Recommendations

Provide a clearly displayed warning message such as &quot;This video may potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. Viewer discretion is advised.&quot;

Excludes flashes contained in a small area, are low contrast or include a small amount of the colour red.

#### Rationale

Flashing content can trigger seizures in end users with photosensitive epilepsy leading to serious health risks for these users.

### WO-7: Bypass Repeating Content

- **Group:** WCAG - Operable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Provide a means of skipping repetitive blocks of content that appear across multiple pages.

#### Control Recommendations

Implement visible and keyboard accessible link(s) for end users to skip repeated content blocks and/or group blocks of repeated material in a way that can be skipped through the use of ARIA landmarks or heading markup.

#### Rationale

End users who navigate sequentially with keyboards or screen readers often encounter repeated content such as headers and navigation links across multiple pages. Providing a mechanism to bypass these repetitive sections enables users to access the main content more efficiently.

### WO-8: Page Title And Purpose

- **Group:** WCAG - Operable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Provide a page title describing the purpose of every web page or distinct Single-Page Application view served from the same Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

#### Control Recommendations

Provide a clear and succinct page title that describes the purpose of the page. For example, &quot;Budget 2024 Support Schemes Calculator&quot; is a clear title stating the page contains a calculator for Support Schemes from Budget 2024.

#### Rationale

Clear, descriptive titles provide quick context, enabling all end users (including users of assistive technologies) to quickly understand where they are without having to scan page content. They also facilitate efficient navigation in site maps and search results, allowing rapid identification of relevant information.

### WO-9: Sequential Focus Order

- **Group:** WCAG - Operable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Ensure focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability when the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation.

#### Control Recommendations

When a user triggers a focusable element like a modal dialog via an element (button or link), the keyboard focus should be set to within the modal and limited to the elements of modal until dismissed.

When the modal is dismissed, the keyboard focus should logically return to the original trigger element to minimise confusion for the user.

#### Rationale

Allows keyboard users to navigate in a sequence that reflects the content&#39;s logical structure, preventing disorientation from unexpected tabbing focus. This approach accommodates various valid navigation patterns while preserving content coherence. Implementing this improves accessibility, often results in cleaner markup, and can enhance SEO, benefiting all users.

### WO-10: Link Text And Purpose

- **Group:** WCAG - Operable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Ensure that link text identifies the purpose of the link and can be interpreted easily on its own.

#### Control Recommendations

Avoid using vague link text such as &quot;click here&quot; or &quot;read more&quot;.

#### Rationale

Descriptive and meaningful link text helps users understand the content and purpose of each link without needing to read the surrounding text. This is especially important for screen reader users who often navigate web pages by jumping from one link to another. It also improves the SEO value of a page and helps all users find the information they need more efficiently.

### WO-11: Multiple Ways

- **Group:** WCAG - Operable
- **Profile Level:** 2

#### Control Statement

Provide at least two ways to reach the same content.

#### Control Recommendations

Focus on information architecture and implement multiple ways to reach content such as clear and logical navigation structures, search function and shortcuts.

#### Rationale

Providing multiple ways to access content allows end users to locate content in ways that best meet their needs. Users may find one navigation path easier or more comprehensible than another, improving both the user experience of the service and the discoverability of content.

### WO-12: Headings and Labels

- **Group:** WCAG - Operable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Provide descriptive headers and labels that identify the context of surrounding text and the component&#39;s purpose.

#### Control Recommendations

Do not disable platform or user-agent default visual focus indicators. If default focus indicators are not available or do not meet other accessible guidelines like colour contrast, modify the background colour or border of the element with focus.

Ensure that &#39;floating&#39; components like widgets and sticky headers do not cover elements receiving focus.

#### Rationale

Allows end users to quickly identify which element or control has keyboard focus. This is especially important for users relying exclusively on keyboards to navigate.

### WO-13: Focus Visible and Not Obscured

- **Group:** WCAG - Operable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Ensure components receiving focus have distinguishable indicators and are not obscured by other elements.

#### Control Recommendations

Do not disable platform or user-agent default visual focus indicators. If default focus indicators are not available or do not meet other accessible guidelines like colour contrast, modify the background colour or border of the element with focus.

Ensure that &#39;floating&#39; components like widgets and sticky headers do not cover elements receiving focus.

#### Rationale

Allows end users to quickly identify which element or control has keyboard focus. This is especially important for users relying exclusively on keyboards to navigate.

### WO-14: Simple Pointer Alternatives

- **Group:** WCAG - Operable
- **Profile Level:** 2

#### Control Statement

Provide single-point alternatives to multipoint or path-based interactions or gestures.

#### Control Recommendations

If multipoint or path-based gestures such as sliders and drag-and-drop functions are used, provide alternative options to perform the same interaction through simple single-point alternatives.

#### Rationale

Interactions that involve complicated gestures or precise movements such as dragging or pinching can be challenging or impossible for end users with mobility disabilities, elderly users, or those using adaptive input devices.

### WO-15: Pointer Cancellation

- **Group:** WCAG - Operable
- **Profile Level:** 2

#### Control Statement

Provide a predictable and consistent way to cancel or undo pointer interactions.

#### Control Recommendations

Implement clear and accessible methods to cancel critical actions such as an &quot;undo&quot; function. Confirmation dialogs can be used as a secondary confirmation for critical actions.

Unless absolutely necessary, only execute a function when the click or touch is released (up-event) instead of when the click or touch is made (down-event). This gives end users the opportunity to cancel the activation after by moving their pointer or finger away from the target before releasing.

#### Rationale

People with various disabilities can accidentally initiate touch or mouse events. Allowing such end users to easily recover from such unintended pointer actions minimises unintended consequences such as accidental submissions.

### WO-16: Label In Name

- **Group:** WCAG - Operable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Ensure that visible text labels of user interface components match or are contained within their programmatic or accessible names.

#### Control Recommendations

Ensure that accessibility labels meaningfully describe the equivalent visual UI element by containing both the visible text label and other contextual descriptors that help assistive technology users fully understand the purpose and interaction.

#### Rationale

Matching visible text labels with the programmatic component supports the use of assistive technologies such as allowing speech-input users to navigate by speaking the visible text labels of components.

### WO-17: Motion Actuation

- **Group:** WCAG - Operable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Provide an option to disable motion control for motion-operated features, and provide alternative means to operate such features.

#### Control Recommendations

When implementing motion-operated features, provide a way to disable motion actuation and offer alternative means to operate these features through user interface components.

Not required when motion is essential to the function, such as in pedometers that require device motion to count steps.

#### Rationale

End users with motor impairments may have difficulty holding or moving a device steadily, which can prevent them from using motion-operated features and may cause accidental triggering of functions.

### WO-18: Minimum Pointer Target Size

- **Group:** WCAG - Operable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Ensure that interactive areas for pointer input are at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels.

#### Control Recommendations

Use min-height and min-width to ensure sufficient target spacing.

If targets have to be smaller than 24-pixels, they must be spaced so that a 24-pixel area around each target does not overlap adjacent targets.

Follow platform guidelines and consider larger target sizes for mobile applications and mobile web browsing where touch is the input mechanism.

Not required if the size of the interactive area is constrained by the line-height of non-interactive text such as text links within a body of text.

#### Rationale

End users with physical and fine motor disabilities require more effort to accurately activate small targets or targets that are close to each other. Ensuring pointer inputs are large enough with sufficient spacing between targets reduces the likelihood of errors from accidentally activating the wrong control.

## WU: WCAG - Understandable (14)

### WU-1: Language of Page

- **Group:** WCAG - Understandable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Ensure that the primary language on a page is programmatically determined.

#### Control Recommendations

For websites, specify the primary language of each webpage using the lang attribute in the HTML tag.

For mobile apps, set the language of the app content using the platform&#39;s appropriate language or accessibility attribute such the accessibilityLanguage attribute for iOS.

For PDFs, use the /Lang entry to specify the language of the document or section.

#### Rationale

Specifying the language ensures that assistive technology can present content to end users using the correct language settings. This includes pronunciation rules and rendering of display characters and scripts.

### WU-2: Language of Parts

- **Group:** WCAG - Understandable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Ensure the language of words or sections that differ from the page&#39;s primary language is programmatically determined.

#### Control Recommendations

Specify the language of text that differs from the primary language of the page using the lang attribute in HTML elements or the platform’s equivalent language tagging feature.

#### Rationale

Allows assistive technology to identify language changes and properly present content in the correct intonation and proper pronunciation to end users.

### WU-3: Unusual Words

- **Group:** WCAG - Understandable
- **Profile Level:** 2

#### Control Statement

Provide definitions for technical jargon and unusual terms.

#### Control Recommendations

Avoid jargon and unusual terms where possible. If absolutely necessary, provide contextual help such as inline explanations, tooltips, or glossaries.

#### Rationale

Slang, jargon, metaphors, and figures of speech may not be understood by some groups of end users. Identifying and providing relevance guidance make such content more accessible to everyone.

### WU-4: Abbreviations

- **Group:** WCAG - Understandable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Provide the expanded form of abbreviations.

#### Control Recommendations

Provide expanded forms of abbreviations the first time they appear on a page or flow, or provide contextual help such as inline explanations, tooltips, or glossaries.

Not required for common abbreviations such as PDF and SMS where presenting the expanded form is unnecessary for understanding of meaning, and may negatively affect the reading experience.

#### Rationale

Abbreviations or acronyms may not be understood by some end users, especially when used for the first time in a page or section.

### WU-5: Changes On Focus

- **Group:** WCAG - Understandable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Avoid changing the context when a user interface component receives focus

#### Control Recommendations

If a component triggers an event when it receives focus, the context should not be changed.

Avoid actions such as form submissions, opening a new window and changing focus to another component when a component receives focus.

#### Rationale

Unexpected changes of context triggered by focus change can be disorienting to users of assistive technology. Ensuring that context changes are predictable helps end users feel secure and in control while navigating a site.

### WU-6: Changes On Input

- **Group:** WCAG - Understandable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Provide advance warning when input causes a change of context.

#### Control Recommendations

Clicking on links or buttons are not considered inputs or changing the setting of that control in the context of this control.

Explicitly inform end users if provision of input like checking a checkbox or entering text into a text field results in a change in context. Changes in context include responses like navigation to a new page or section, submission, or opening a new window.

Alternatively, provide controls such as buttons that allow end users to intentionally trigger actions like confirming a selection or submission.

#### Rationale

Unexpected changes of context triggered by input can be disorienting to users of assistive technology. Ensuring that context changes are predictable helps users feel secure and in control while navigating a site.

### WU-7: Consistent Navigation

- **Group:** WCAG - Understandable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Implement a primary or main navigation panel that

- 1. Is placed at or near the top of the website
- 2. Is not hidden or collapsed within an icon on desktop for websites
- 3. Presents navigation links in the same relative order on each page

#### Control Recommendations

Test the top navigation component with users to ensure it is usable and accessible.

#### Rationale

Unexpected changes of context triggered by focus change can be disorienting to end users with sensory or cognitive impairment, or users of assistive technology.

### WU-8: Consistent Identification

- **Group:** WCAG - Understandable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Identify and label repeated or related components consistently within the digital service.

#### Control Recommendations

Ensure that text used to identify a component such as label, name, or text alternatives are identical for each user interface component with the same function within the digital service.

#### Rationale

Allows end users to quickly learn and understand navigation, design and interaction patterns within the digital service. This reduces cognitive load and increase efficiency of task completion.

### WU-9: Consistent Help

- **Group:** WCAG - Understandable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Place help and support mechanisms consistently across multiple pages.

#### Control Recommendations

Implementing the tl-4: Official Government Footer ensures consistent placement of contact and FAQ across multiple pages.

Ensure that other help and support mechanisms such as messaging systems or chatbots are also consistently placed across multiple pages.

#### Rationale

Help and assistance are key aspects of a digital service. Consistent placement makes it easy for end users, especially those who may struggle with complex or unfamiliar interfaces to find help and support mechanisms.

### WU-10: Error Identification

- **Group:** WCAG - Understandable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Indicate input errors by:

- a) Visually and audibly identifying the component or section that generated the error
- b) Providing a text description of the error

#### Control Recommendations

Clearly associate error messages with the source component or section. Ensure the error is easily identifiable and noticeable visually and for users of screen readers by using techniques such as ARIA attributes and requirements in wp-11.

#### Rationale

Helping end users easily and quickly identify, locate and understand errors minimises the frustration of encountering and resolving errors.

### WU-11: Error Suggestion

- **Group:** WCAG - Understandable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Ensure that error messages:

- a) Explain what went wrong in non-technical language.
- b) Explain how to correct the issue or provide alternative actions (If suggestions for correction are known)

#### Control Recommendations

Write error messages in plain language that is understood by end users of different backgrounds, and helps the user understand or resolve the issue. This applies to all error messages including inline form errors and system error pages such as 404, 500 errors.

#### Rationale

Error messages that are not clear or do not provide useful and actionable information prevent end users from completing their tasks and lead to frustration.

### WU-12: Error Prevention

- **Group:** WCAG - Understandable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Prevent errors by:

- a) Checking user-entered data for errors and/or providing a mechanism to review, confirm, and correct information before final submission
- b) Allow submissions to be reversed (if feasible)

#### Control Recommendations

Implement proper error validation.

Provide a summary page or section for users to review and correct their inputs/information before submission. This is essential for multi-page forms which are difficult to review, and transactions with significant consequences such as those involving payments or having legal implications.

#### Rationale

Providing ways for end users to confirm, correct, or reverse important submissions reduces the chance of errors.

### WU-13: Redundant Entry

- **Group:** WCAG - Understandable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Avoid requiring re-entry of information already provided within the same process.

#### Control Recommendations

Either auto-populate or allow the end user to select information that was already provided.

This is not required if the information is required to ensure the security of the content (E.g. Confirm password) or if the previously entered information is no longer valid.

#### Rationale

Repetitive data entry requires unnecessary effort especially for end users with cognitive or motor impairments who may struggle with entering information.

### WU-14: Accessible Authentication (Minimum)

- **Group:** WCAG - Understandable
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Provide accessible authentication alternatives that do not require recalling, solving, or transcribing information.

#### Control Recommendations

Provide at least 1 non-password authentication such as Singpass QR login or text/email based one-time codes.

#### Rationale

End users with cognitive impairments have difficulties recalling or performing cognitively demanding actions.

## WR: WCAG - Robust (2)

### WR-1: Name, Role, Value

- **Group:** WCAG - Robust
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Ensure that essential information of custom components and controls can be identified and read by assistive technologies.

#### Control Recommendations

Essential information including name, roles, properties, values, states, and state changes are provided using techniques like ARIA labels.

Standard HTML controls should already meet this criterion when used according to specification. (example: text input field)

#### Rationale

Enables end users of assistive technology to properly understand and interact with custom components.

### WR-2: Status Messages

- **Group:** WCAG - Robust
- **Profile Level:** 1

#### Control Statement

Ensure that assistive technology can identify and announce system status changes that don&#39;t receive focus.

#### Control Recommendations

Use ARIA roles and properties to inform users of status changes, such as when an incorrect text in an input is entered and a status message appears above.

#### Rationale

Allows screen readers to identify and announce changes to content that may otherwise be missed by users of assistive technologies. This benefits users with visual impairments who unlike sighted users may not notice changes outside of their area of focus.
