<p>### Agency Users</p>
<p>Agency Users refer to all Agency and non-Agency personnel (e.g. Third
Party personnel) who are granted access to ICT&amp;SS to perform official
work for that Agency.</p>
<p>### Public Users</p>
<p>Public Users refer to all General Public users who access and use Digital
Services from within or outside Singapore.</p>
<p>### Digital Service</p>
<p>A Digital Service refers to any service provided by the Singapore Public
Service that is delivered through digital systems, tools or platforms,
that allows Public Users to access information, perform tasks, or complete
transactions related to the government and public service.</p>
<p>A Digital Service can be:</p>
<p>1. Web-based</p>
<p>2. Mobile application</p>
<p>3. Others (such as desktop applications)</p>
<p>A Digital Service can contain one or more pages/screens, tools or Transactional
Services.</p>
<p>### Transactional Service</p>
<p>A Transactional Service is a Digital Service that involves Public User
action resulting in:</p>
<p>1. The exchange of information, goods, services or money between a citizen
or business and the government, and/or</p>
<p>2. A change to Government Data</p>
<p>The exchange does not need to be successful (e.g. approved or accepted)
for the Digital Service to be considered a Transactional Service. The outcome
need not be immediately available and may be delivered through digital
or non-digital channels (e.g. email, post, phone).</p>
<p>The following are not considered transactional exchanges:</p>
<p>1. Login/authentication to access a digital service (e.g. Singpass login
or username/password authentication)</p>
<p>2. User consent or acknowledgement required by the underlying system or
platform (e.g. accepting browser or operating system level terms or cookie
tracking notices)</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
</p>
<p>A Public User logs in to a Digital Service containing both Transactional
Services and static informational content. The act of logging in grants
access but is not itself a transaction. While in the Digital Service, the
user proceeds to submit an application to get a license. The application
flow to get the license is a Transactional Service even if the outcome
is later communicated by email or post.</p>
<p>The categories and examples of transactional services are shown in below
table.</p>
