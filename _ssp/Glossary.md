### Agency Users

Agency Users refer to all Agency and non-Agency personnel (e.g. Third Party personnel) who are granted access to ICT&SS to perform official work for that Agency.

### Public Users

Public Users refer to all General Public users who access and use Digital Services from within or outside Singapore.

### Digital Service

A Digital Service refers to any service provided by the Singapore Public Service that is delivered through digital systems, tools or platforms, that allows Public Users to access information, perform tasks, or complete transactions related to the government and public service.

A Digital Service can be:

1. Web-based

2. Mobile application

3. Others (such as desktop applications)

A Digital Service can contain one or more pages/screens, tools or Transactional Services.

### Transactional Service

A Transactional Service is a Digital Service that involves Public User action resulting in:

1. The exchange of information, goods, services or money between a citizen or business and the government, and/or

2. A change to Government Data

The exchange does not need to be successful (e.g. approved or accepted) for the Digital Service to be considered a Transactional Service. The outcome need not be immediately available and may be delivered through digital or non-digital channels (e.g. email, post, phone).

The following are not considered transactional exchanges:

1. Login/authentication to access a digital service (e.g. Singpass login or username/password authentication)

2. User consent or acknowledgement required by the underlying system or platform (e.g. accepting browser or operating system level terms or cookie tracking notices)

**Example:**

A Public User logs in to a Digital Service containing both Transactional Services and static informational content. The act of logging in grants access but is not itself a transaction. While in the Digital Service, the user proceeds to submit an application to get a license. The application flow to get the license is a Transactional Service even if the outcome is later communicated by email or post.

The categories and examples of transactional services are shown in below table.

\### Non-Transactional Service

A Non-Transactional Service is a Digital Service that enables Public Users to access general or personalised information, or engage with the government without requiring the exchange of information, goods, services or money, or changes to government data.
