### AS-6: Password Salting and Hashing

* **Group:** [Application Security](/catalog/as)
* **Profile:** [Low-Risk - Level 1](/profiles/low-risk/level-1), [Sandbox - Level 2](/profiles/sandbox/level-2)

#### Control Statement

Store passwords as salted hashes using a password hashing scheme that is resistant to offline attacks such as those described in NIST [SP 800-63b](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b). The salt should be:
 * Generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator in accordance with industry standards;
 * At least 32 bits long; and
 * Randomly generated for each account.


#### Control Recommendations

Refer to NIST [SP 800-90Ar1](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-90Ar1) for suitable pseudo-random number generators. Refer to NIST [SP 800-63b](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b) Memorized Secret Verifiers section for suitable hashing schemes, including Argon2, scrypt, and PBKDF2. For application source code, use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator function instead of an insecure one, such as crypto.randomBytes instead of Math.random in Node.js and java.security.SecureRandom.nextBytes instead of java.util.Random in Java.

#### Risk Statement

Without salting and hashing, in case of a data breach, exposed passwords can be easily extracted, leading to potential compromise of user accounts and sensitive information.

### NS-1: Public and Private Subnet Segmentation

* **Group:** [Network Security](/catalog/ns)
* **Profile:** [Low-Risk - Level 1](/profiles/low-risk/level-1), [Sandbox - Level 2](/profiles/sandbox/level-2)

#### Control Statement

Place private resources (e.g., databases) in private subnets and public resources (e.g., reverse proxies, web servers) in public subnets within a virtual network.

#### Control Recommendations

This control does not apply to serverless resources (API Gateways), static sites or assets fronted by CDNs (e.g., CloudFlare, CloudFront) which are located outside of the virtual network. Private subnets do not allow direct connections from the internet while public subnets do. However, resources in private segments can connect to the internet via NAT Gateways in public subnets in the same virtual network.

#### Risk Statement

Failure to segregate private and public resources within distinct subnets in a virtual network increases the risk of unauthorised access to sensitive data, as private resources may be exposed to the public internet, compromising the overall security of the infrastructure.

### NS-2: Access Restrictions on CSP Resources Outside Virtual Network

* **Group:** [Network Security](/catalog/ns)
* **Profile:** [Low-Risk - Level 1](/profiles/low-risk/level-1), [Sandbox - Level 2](/profiles/sandbox/level-2)

#### Control Statement

Restrict access to CSP resources outside of a virtual network (e.g., Lambda, DynamoDb, API Gateways, S3, CloudFront) using access controls or application layer authorisation.

#### Control Recommendations

Apply access restrictions appropriate to the resource type. Access through interface VPC endpoints is only required if the client is hosted in a private subnet. For example:

* Restrict access to DynamoDB with IAM policies.

* Restrict access to API Gateway with Lambda Authorizers or authorisation middlewares at the application layer. If the API Gateway is exposed to private subnets, create a [private API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-private-apis.html).

* Restrict access to S3 Buckets with IAM policies and block public access from the internet.

#### Risk Statement

Lack of access restrictions raises the risk of unauthorised access, data exposure, and potential misuse of critical services, compromising the overall security posture.

### NS-4: Inter-Private Network Connectivity

* **Group:** [Network Security](/catalog/ns)
* **Profile:** [Low-Risk - Level 1](/profiles/low-risk/level-1), [Sandbox - Level 2](/profiles/sandbox/level-2)

#### Control Statement

Route network traffic between private networks without going through the internet.

#### Control Recommendations

Use CSP Private endpoint services (e.g., AWS PrivateLink with VPC endpoints) when you want to allow one or more consumer VPCs unidirectional access to a specific service or set of instances in the service provider VPC. Otherwise, use VPC peering and Transit Gateway when you want to enable layer-3 IP connectivity between VPCs. Refer to the [Multi-VPC AWS Network Infrastructure Whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/vpc-to-vpc-connectivity.html) for further guidance.

#### Risk Statement

When routing through the internet, there's an increased risk of man-in-the-middle and spoofing attacks. Allowing bidirectional access between networks without fine-grained access controls increases the risk of unauthorized access, potential data exfiltration, and compromise of network security compared to unidirectional access to specific resources.
