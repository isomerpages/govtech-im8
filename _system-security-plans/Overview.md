# System Security Plans

## Purpose

Within the OSCAL framework, a **system security plan** (SSP) represents a description of the control **implementation** of an information system.

For the purposes of IM8-lite, the SSP model forms the main compliance document for agencies. The SSP describes how controls are implemented by the specific system components and parties.
