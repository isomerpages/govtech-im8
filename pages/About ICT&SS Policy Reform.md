    <div class="col is-12"><p>The ICT&amp;SS Policy Reform is an effort to transform the policy controls
to be lean, relevant and effective. It <strong>enables&nbsp;differentiated treatment for
systems of different risk materiality levels </strong>. Agencies will assess the risks and apply the right level of controls for their systems based on various business and technical considerations.
</p><p>The reform effort has started for low-risk systems first. <strong>The first tranche of the recommended controls for low-risk systems is published <a href="/control-catalog/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a> and will be progressively updated in this website.</strong>
