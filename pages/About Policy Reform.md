<p>To support Singaporeâ€™s ambition to build a Smart Nation, the Government
has accelerated its digital transformation efforts.&nbsp;This includes <strong>improving how services are delivered, operations are managed, and policies are made.</strong> 
<br>
<br>The Instruction Manual for Infocomm Technology &amp; Smart Systems (ICT&amp;SS)
provide <strong>policy guidance to government agencies on how to protect and manage their ICT&amp;SS assets</strong>.
<br>
<br>The ICT&amp;SS Policy Reform is an effort to transform the policy controls
to be lean, relevant and effective. It <strong>enables&nbsp;differentiated treatment</strong> for
systems of different risk materiality levels. Agencies will assess the
risks and choose the appropriate controls for their systems based on factors
such as cost and effort.&nbsp;</p>
