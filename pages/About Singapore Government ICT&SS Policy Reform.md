<p>To support Singaporeâ€™s ambition to build a Smart Nation, the Government
has accelerated its digital transformation efforts.&nbsp;This includes <strong>improving how services are delivered, operations are managed and policies are defined to protect agencies'  infocomm technology and smart system (ICT&amp;SS) assets.</strong> </p>
		
<p>The ICT&amp;SS Policy Reform is an effort to transform the policy controls
to be lean, relevant and effective. It <strong>enables&nbsp;differentiated treatment for
systems of different risk impact levels</strong>. Agencies will assess the risks and identify the right level of controls for their systems based on various business and technical considerations.
